        "text": "I decided to try this place's lunch buffet so I could get a good idea of what they offered.  While there were a few good dishes on the buffet, I guess the flavors weren't quite what I expected. Also, the paneer was really quite hard and the pakora was over cooked and more hard than crispy. The goat curry was quite good, but I don't think I could justify coming back for just that. They may have a lot of selections, but having less selections and concentrating on quality might be the better way to go.\n\nI must say, the service is very good and their attentiveness is outstanding. It's something the other Indian lunch buffets here in Vegas could really use.",

This is the only mall I know of, other than South Coast Plaza, that has Zara and Mango, plus I was excited to see Madewell. If only they had an H&M! You can find some really great sales at this mall and there are tons of stores for everyone.\n\nThe layout can be kind of confusing because I think it is 2 levels in some places and 3 in others. Plus there is parking underground. Don't worry, just come back a few times and you'll figure it out. I used to shop here even before it got totally remodelled a while ago and it only gotten better!",

I finally went a few weeks back with the international supper club. The people who work here were accommodating, taking good care of our large group. The food, unfortunately, was not so awesome. I liked the little pancaky bread with the slightly spicy sauce... That was good. The laksa, on the other hand, was totally lacking. They billed it as a spicy soup, but it wasn't spicy at all. Additionally, I asked for no seafood and it had a ton of rubbery seafood in it. This being said, I might go back to try something else. The prices here were affordable and they had a wide variety of dishes. It's possible that this place is great and I just don't like Malaysian food... So that's something to consider.",

(You can still see original fatburger retro tables, metal backsplash and soda machine lol) Mmmm! A Korean/Japanese place! Korean owned! They have at least got to have killer Korean food right? WRONG! The beef bulgogi was WAY WAY off. What small amount of beef that came on our plate was thickly sliced, saturated in meat tenderizer, and came on top of a bed of vegetables. Bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms with Bulgogi? Never had it like that before. It was more like a bad stir fry. It looked pretty though, that's about it. We also ordered one of the rolls that was topped with eel. The eel was undercooked, slimy, and just plain gross. The spicy tuna and crabmeat mix inside the roll was off too.  It just did not taste fresh. The yellowtail and scallion roll was the best, but still not anything to write home about. The soft shell crab roll was pretty horrific as well. The eel sauce had a funky sickly sweet flavor that lingered in a bad way. It just didn't taste right.  We also ordered the chicken fried rice. That was pretty clean, light in flavor, but overly black peppered. Black pepper in fried rice? Me thinks not!  If they switch over to WHITE PEPPER the fried rice would be more edible.  All three of us were so glad that we didn't order more, and left very disappointed.   \n\nThe rice is cooked perfectly! A+++! The staff is super nice.  I just wish they would serve more traditional Korean fare...and serve fresher sushi!",

What's really cool about this eatery is they are vegetarian friendly, you can order any gourmet hot dog on the menu and substitute with soy dog. They offer amazing house specials like Seoul chicken wings, mac n'cheese bacon quesadilla, bulgogi burrito, bibim rice bowl, Korean chicken noodle soup, and a few selection of gourmet fries that are fantastic.\n\nI had the Unsweetened Tea, Angry Gourmet Hot Dog ($7.95), Euro Special Fries ($8.95), and Corn Dog ($2.95). For the hot dog, I substitute the spicy bulgogi pork for a vegetarian soy dog. It is prepared as bite size pieces in a nontoast bun. The meat is cooked thoroughly, it has good flavor, and it is topped with a crunchy Asian slaw, diced jalape\u00f1o, and a fiery aioli that taste more like a mild kind of spicy goodness. The topping definitely adds mouthwatering flavor to the hot dog. I love how everything came in unison, it's a harmonious encore of good food, and it taste amazing! \n\nAs for the Corn Dog, they use chicken instead of pork or beef. The corn dog batter is just enough coating for the meat to cook. It is serve hot golden brown, outside texture is crispy, and it can be addictive to snack on. Another great item are the Euro Special Gourmet Fries, which is certainly a must have for any first visit. It is serve as very crispy fries with cheese, garlic aioli, and I substitute bacon for a fried egg that is cooked sunny side up. When you mix a piece of that fried egg with melted cheese and tasty garlic fries, it makes every single bite super yummy and totally worth having more. \n\nThe service is very good and they are friendly. I had many questions about the menu items and they are patient to answer, just let them know about your preference. They have a huge menu board! You can substitute or add toppings, and they are more than happy to accommodate. Service is fast and food is delivered hot to your table within 10 minutes. You can refill your drink at the soda fountain and the atmosphere is pretty laid back. As for food truck, they are holding off on that due to winter season. You can always check updates on their social media when food truck becomes available. They also do catering for private events and if ever you need them for birthday parties, weddings, reunions, or any social gatherings, contact them for details. By the way, they are closed on Sunday.",

But to my surprise I was quite pleased with this place! \n\nI got the strawberry shortcake and green tea cake. They were about $2-4 each (will check prices next time), but that's actually basically considered \"normal\" in Japan so I don't mind the prices too much. \n\nThe strawberry shortcake tasted just like the ones I've had in my local bakeries back in Japan, there's a slight difference, but it's hardly noticeable. I will definitely be getting more of them! They aren't sweet and some may not like it because it definitely isn't like American sweets at all. It's like a sponge cake base but it is not as fluffy as American sponge cake, it may seem a little bland to some (my friend felt it was bland). \n\nThe green tea cake is just like matcha green tea taste. If you're a fan of green tea and something not super sweet this is another good one, it also tastes like the ones from Japan as well. \n\nThe two I've tried so far have very authentic tastes from Japan, I will definitely be coming back to try other things!",

I think if they shorten and tighten up the menu and concentrate on a few items they'd probably do better. The eggs Benedict were ok but nothing awesome, breakfast burrito filling but that's about it. Bloody Mary's? A little over priced for the quality. The food came out luke warm and the servers seemed almost annoyed when we needed to flag them down for something like a refill or simply just utensils. Unfortunate.",

I loved the patio it was a great atmosphere for a meal. \nOur server was super friendly and helped me out when I was looking to get a half caff latte but they had to improvise as they were out of some ingredients. The coffee was perfect when I got it. \nI got the kind of catch all breakfast, two fried eggs, black beans, grits and toast. \nThe eggs were cooked way more than I had wanted but were decent. The grits were totally flavorless. The black beans were my favorite, they were good. \nOverall I found the breakfast to be very bland but would be interested in trying something else on the menu. I saw some people eating hash type breakfasts that looked delicious.",

        "text": "It pains me to write such a negative review of North Italia as my partner and I have always loved this chain and had nothing but positive experiences in their other restaurants - even recommending it to friends, however I was unfortunately very mistaken in thinking that this location would reach the same standards as previous experiences had set for us.\n\nIt all started when we walked through the door and reached the hostess station.\n\nWe arrived just before 8pm on November 20th, a weekday, for dinner and drinks, a party of 2. We were seen by a young girl with long blonde hair and told that there was nothing available at that time, but it would be a 20 min wait. We had no problem with this and told her we'd take a seat at the bar. North Italia have a text service that supposedly alerts the party when they are ready to be seated so for the next 30 mins, after a drink each at the bar, we were still looking at the phone, waiting for a text from the hostess standing 5 steps away from us. \n\nI decided after 40 mins of waiting - DOUBLE what we anticipated, that I would approach the hostess and see if there was any progress on a table for 2. Without looking up, I just got \"what's your name again?\" and after she scanned the restaurant, I got a \"no ones leaving at the moment, it could be another 20mins. I don't know\".\n\nUseful..\n\nAt this point, I was frustrated and very hungry. However, after the hostess told me that we were the next in line to be seated, I returned to the bar, waited and finally saw a party leave. Yay!!!\n\nBut wait.. \n\nThe same hostess that had told me, now 50 mins ago, that it'd be a 20 min wait and told me 10 mins ago that we were next to be seated, just totally ignored us and took another walk-in party to a table. \n\nI couldn't believe it. I returned to the hostess stand where there was now a short brunette to cover. I explained the above. She told me that the party just seated had been waiting longer, so I questioned why I was told we were next. Then she told me that she was unable to text me, showing me the screen with a whited out button next to my reservation. This confused me that they had apparently tried to text me when they had just said they weren't ready to seat us yet, but when I had explained that I was sat waiting the past hour within five steps of the hostess stand and could just have been called over, she had nothing except \"yehh, sorry\".\n\nAt this point, the blond returned and ignored us, before the brunette checked her system and said \"it looks like someone is receiving their check, so it'll be 5 mins.\" If that's the case, I don't know why the blond couldn't have checked this same system earlier and given a better approximation as to waiting times. \n\nNevertheless, despite an HOUR wait, 2 less than helpful hostesses, several system failures and a partridge in a pear tree, WE WERE FINALLY BEING SEATED!\n\nWe ordered a salad to share, which came out very quickly thank goodness. It was flavourful, with a good amount of dressing and it was nice that they had split the dish onto two plates for us. The pizza came not long after. It was a good size and nice and hot! We would have loved some additional condiments, but unfortunately there was no check back from the server, so we called it quits, paid the bill and left.\n\nSuch a let down! We had originally come to this location with high hopes, optimism and originally wanted to inquire about purchasing the gift card special that they had for the holidays. By the end, that was the last thing on our minds. \n\nPlease do better North Italia at the Plaza! You're letting the side down!",

        "text": "I came here yesterday for lunch.  Having never tried Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) before, I was eager to try some KFC wings and drumsticks, esp. since I'm a fried chicken aficionado.  However, when I ordered (at 12:30pm), they told me they were out of drumsticks, so I was only able to order wings, which was disappointing.  I ordered the snack size, which comes with 6 wings, with soy garlic sauce, and I was told it'd be 15 min.  I don't often buy lunch in Oakland, but this seems like a long wait, esp. compared to other lunch places nearby, and I ended up waiting about that long.\n\nRe: the wings, I found them quite crispy and delicious, and definitely worth trying.  I wasn't a huge fan of the soy garlic sauce, since it was pretty sweet (akin to sauces served at Americanized Chinese restaurants); next time, I think I'll get it on the side, if possible.  (Obviously, I can't comment on authenticity or compare, since this was my first time trying KFC.)  I also tried a sample of the taro bubble tea during the grand opening, and found it kind of bland, hence why I didn't order any.  I also found the prices a bit high--6 wings set me back $6.19 (w/ tax)--esp. given the inexpensiveness of other lunch options in the neighborhood.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the wings, and would recommend them to people who haven't tried KFC or are craving it (there aren't any alternative options in PGH).  However, this restaurant has some kinks to work out re: service and pricing that detracted from my experience.  I'd stop back in again, but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to do so.",

All food was served quickly and the gentleman behind the counter was very accommodating. First off, we tried the cheese curds. If you've ever been to the Midwest and eaten at Culver's; then these curds will be very familiar. The curds are small and the portion wasn't the greatest but they did taste good. Definitely not worth the price. We also ordered a large plain French fries. The fries are huge. Not huge in the sense of the portion but the fries themselves are large. While my son did eat these, I thought they were very bland. They do look good though. Lol. We could've gotten the poutine but we thought it would've been too much food. We'll probably try the chicken Parmesan next time. We ordered a pepperoni pizza company size which was huge. If you're a fan of New York style pizza, you will love this. Huge slices full of pepperoni and grease. We are definitely coming back and we'll try the poutine next time. Overall, good food with very reasonable prices.",

I'd see it every time from the I-15 freeway as I drove between Downtown and Belz Outlet (now known as Las Vegas Outlet South). I didn't even know what it was. \n\nThis time, we needed dinner and this restaurant was relatively close by. I was with the Yelpers from Los Angeles and they knew what it was. One had been to this location and the other gal had been to other locations across the US. The closest Cracker Barrel to LA is in Victorville...kind of a far drive...\n\nSo...it was time for me to get schooled. Cracker Barrel is a Country Store with a restaurant. We entered through the store and were immediately greeted with the fragrance of the Holiday Season! It was the scent of cinnamon, Christmas tree, and happiness all-in-one!  We perused the clothing, greeting cards, candles, candy, plushies, and more! Besides UNLV gear, there was a small supply of Golden Knights golf shirts. I snatched one up!  Yay!\n\nOn the restaurant side, the decor is memorabilia and knick knacks from days long past. I recognized a wash board, a coffee grinder, and farm tools. The fireplace caught my attention and I wondered if it's lit during the wintertime?\n\nI didn't take photos of the menus because it's overwhelming! We got three menus: breakfast (served all day), lunch and dinner, and the specials. Wow...so many choices! I finally selected the Fresh Start which included a yogurt, blueberry muffin, fresh fruit, eggs, and Bacon! Yum! Chel gave me a dumpling (from chicken and dumplings) off of her Sampler platter and it was a good food exposure for me. Haha! I was full from the complimentary cornbread and biscuits (mmm), so I took them to go!\n\nJamie was our patient, good humored, hard working, and efficient server!  She endured our \"jokes\" and offered me a refill of my Holiday tea before I asked! Jamie brought us more Apple Butter when ours \"slipped\" off from the table and she made our visit a pleasant one!\n\nI sure would return with more friends and family! This is such a comforting place with a warm, homey feel! It was a great kick start to our Holiday Season!",

I know that flavor well as I've eaten a million of them give or take.\n\nI don't recall any other spot in Las Vegas doing their \"Scallion pancake\" made to order from scratch, and this one is absolutely stellar.  The only con is the wait, since this is typically a starter dish, but even though this isn't brought as soon as I would like it to be, I forget all about those 15 minutes upon my first bite. \n\nIn fact, all of their starchy goodness is made that way and forgoing at least one order of these from their extensive (for the burbs) array of dumplings and pancakes would be a mistake.  A couple of notable favorites are the classic pork and chive dumplings and the \"can't believe there's no meat in the\" vegetable and egg pancake. They're really big compared to other versions around. \n\nThe spicy beef noodle soup, which is better than the signature bowl, is something I'd still be down with in sweltering Vegas heat.  Their mapo tofu is outstanding as well.  Easily the best Far East food.....in Far West Vegas.",

Very tasteful grey walls, some appliqu\u00e9s depicting grasses and birds as well as an indian design which is reminiscent of henna designs.  The patio had many tables with good lighting.  I predict that when the weather becomes more agreeable, the patio will be packed.  \nThe complementary condiments (cilantro chutney, tamarind and marinated carrots were delightful with the lentil chips (I forget their indian name).  \nWe had chicken vindaloo, spinach, chicken biryani accompanied with raita.  The portions were large but it was the amazing taste of this fresh food that had us on cloud nine. Crazy good.\nThey have a wine and beer menu which was super reasonable and we partook of that as well.  Didn't have room for dessert but will make room for dessert next time.\nThe service is always great here.

I went into the bathroom at Diamond's, and I almost hurled.  I am a mortician and around putrid smells every day of my life, so for the smell of a bathroom to turn my stomach is reeeally saying something.  I felt obligated to stay and eat.  I left the bathroom and used antibacterial hand sanitizer instead.  :(  So the food began to appear.  We ordered a big pot of oolong tea to accompany our meal.  We were warned that it, along with the glasses of water on our table, was tap water.  The steamed white rice was fine and dandy, and I ate most of it.  We got dungeness crab, served chopped up but still in the shell and smothered in a brown gravy sauce that was none-too-tasty and killed the delicious crab taste.  We also had lobster that was similarly served chopped into pieced and smothered in sauce, with the meat still inside.  This method of serving made it difficult to handle the food without getting your hands dirty, including serving it to yourself from the lazy susan.  We also had cod with all the bones in it and the eyeballs still in its head, completely intact.  I did not even taste it, as I've had some bad experiences with fish bones.  The rest of the table ate the whole thing, including the fish brain and eyeballs and cheeks.  *shudder*  Just a matter of personal preference, but I can't do that.  \n\nAll in all, I would never go back.  Ever.  And I'd advise anyone with a weak stomach or a strong sense of smell to avoid this place at all costs.  Again, this is simply my preference and opinion.  But I like to taste my food, not just the seasoned gravy thrown onto it.  And the smell... oh good heavens!  Check please!",

About a 15 minute wait. No problem, it's a small place. We were seated and given menus and we placed orders but didn't receive our first roll until nearly 30 minutes after we ordered. \n\nI believe the reason for this is the place was just slammed. They got unlucky and a whole bunch of people showed up at once and the orders poured in. Nobody left for the first half and hour we were there. They've got to streamline their back of house to take care of this situation. The food was trickling out of the bar when there were four guys back there. \n\nThe servers did a great job of making sure everyone was as happy as possible but there is only but so much servers can do when there is no food. On top of it more than a few tables got rolls they didn't order, I myself got a double order when I clearly placed one order. This kind of stuff just snowballs inefficiency and really adds up. Some of the rolls were very tasty. My favorite was the mango crunch. It was fresh and new and different. On the other hand other rolls were very lazily made. One of my rolls wasn't sealed and fell apart every time I picked up a piece. Another roll was sloppy and clunky and made eating a mouthful at a time impossible. \n\nThe food was good though. The nigiri was fresh and the portions of fish were generous. The free house sake with check in was great. \n\nAt times some of the servers seemed a bit unprofessional and were scratching and moving in odd ways. Nothing devious of nasty, just not the demeanor a pro server should have. \n\nOverall If this place tightened up the rough edges just a bit this is an easy 5 star for me. It was worth the money to try. I'd recommend going when it's not busy. Lunchtime or a weekday.",

They had a good variety of slot machines, but most were always full! I didn't attempt to play any of the table games, but it looked like there were empty seats at a few. The drinks servers are few and far between, so make sure you get their attention when you see one.\n\nOverall, Wild Horse Pass is definitely recommended over Fort McDowell Casino, but I will have to check out the other casinos in this area the next time I'm in Arizona!",

Unfortunately, for us, we weren't super impressed with the service or food. \n\nWe ordered delivery on Sunday night. I was told it would be an hour wait, which was completely fine! 2 hours came by and I was literally about to call the place when the delivery guy knocked on the door. He apologized for being late (kinda laughing while saying it) and said they lost our ticket. I mean, I get it, people make misstakes in life. But geez, throw in a egg roll or something or atleast be sincere with an apology. Because of this, I have a feeling our food was just sitting under a warmer for a very long time.\n\nI ordered the red curry chicken and my husband ordered the chicken pad thai. The red curry was actually very good. Big portion of chicken, veggies, rice, and red curry sauce. The pad thai was very much lacking. It was super sweet (even though we asked for like 4 star spicy) and tasted crazy bland and a bit stale (maybe like it had been sitting under a warmer for the past hour). Prices were a bit high for dinner. With tip and delivery fee, our total was about $30 or so. \n\nIf we decide to go back again, we definitely will be skipping the delivery and just picking up instead.",

They have fish tanks of live seafood you can order which is pretty neat.  The menu is pretty giant and they have a good sized selection of vegetarian food.  The vegetable with black mushroom dish I had was very good it just took a really long time to come out.  My buddies's peking duck came out about 10 minutes before mine.  I'm not really sure what happened. Our waitress was very nice and helpfull with the menu and our questions about the food before we ordered.

The flavor was good, nice ingredients like avocado and bacon, but the fish was overcooked. I tried to power through because I enjoyed the flavor, but just couldn't get past the rubbery, chewy fish. I ended up just pulling the fish off of the sandwich and finished it as a bacon/veggie sandwich sans fish.\n\nI decided to give this place a second chance, maybe the last time was a one-off situation. I ordered the grilled chicken cobb sandwich with fries, and experienced deja vu. I took a bite into the sandwich and the whole piece of chicken slid off with it. Again, the flavor was there, the pretzel bun was good. I tried another bite and couldn't get past the rubbery chicken. I again, pulled the piece of chicken off of the sandwich and ended up eating a bacon/veggie sandwich.\n\nIf I wanted to eat rubber for dinner, I would just stay at home and gnaw on my dog's Kong.

If you know me, I'm constantly on the hunt for delicious wood fired pizza. Some friends told me their favorite pizza of all time was from Piccolo Forno so I had to see what it was all about. My husband and I ordered the Quattro Stagioni pizza, Pappardelle con Coniglio alla Garfagnana (braised spiced rabbit with pappardelle pasta), tiramisu and... Gosh for the life of me, I cannot remember the name of the dessert I ordered. It was a cappuccino gelato ball, really. \n\nAnyway, the pizza had four toppings on four different areas of the pie, making it a nice sampling. The pizza was pretty good. Not too salty and pretty well balanced. My favorite topping was the prosciutto and my husband's favorite was the roasted red pepper. The mushrooms were my least favorite as they had a very strong smokey flavor, which I'm sure many might enjoy. Although the pizza was good, I liked the pasta more. All their pastas are made in-house which is really impressive. The braised rabbit and sauce of our pasta dish had a comforting, curry-like flavor which was perfect for a cold day. \n\nNow. Onto the star of the show. The dessert!! My cappuccino gelato ball (I wish I could remember the name of this!) was AMAZING. As if plain gelato wasn't rich enough, the ball had a filling and was drizzled with caramel and chocolate syrup. I may come back just for this! The tiramisu was nice and light with an orange flavor. The entrees were good but the desserts were great!",

I wanted so badly to take a picture but realized how awkward that would be.\nService wasn't good at all. Not attentive, friendly, or nice. I ordered an Arnold Palmer and I was given lemonade. I see things like this as a simple mistake so I kindly asked for tea since I ordered half and half. The server (we actually had three people just rotating the whole time) told me that there was probably tea in it, and I just can't tell because the tea is very subtle. I continued to tell her it was just lemonade but she said \"yeah it's just the tea isn't really prominent\" ... Then when another lady came to refill my drink, she topped it off with the house tea that I asked for. Seeing as how I barely touched my drink... It was weird to me that the tea instantly made my drink darker and the taste was definitely prominent. But I guess that was too hard for the first lady.\nOur food came out within fifteen minutes which really surprised me because there were quite a few others there as well.\nNo complaints with my eggs benedict, just thought it was a little pricey. The chicken fried steak was cold and soggy. Almost like it had been pre cooked and re heated. I could tell the flavor was there but overall it just wasn't appetizing because it didn't taste or feel fresh at all. We had no one check on our table to see how the food was. But of course they didn't hesitate to drop the check at the table and walk away.\nOverall I'm very surprised and disappointed. I saw all the awesome reviews and also recognized it is Zagat rated which inclined me to go here. But after paying so much for lack luster food and terrible customer service... I'll pass on returning.",

There's a long slide that can only be accessed by taking an elevator to the 2nd floor.  Please note: the height requirement is 48\".  Hubby went on it and said it was fun but hard to see the sharks as you come down since it's so fast.  However, it was fun just to wade in the pool and view the sealife in the aquarium.  The illusion is cool if you're in the pool and it looks like you're swimming with the sharks.  Tip:  bring goggles to get the full effect.   Although the pool officially closes at 8 pm, there are folks getting drinks from the bar afterwards and settling in a nice cozy couch huddling near the firepits.  I heard the jacuzzi stays open until 2 am?!  \nYou dont have to be a guest to play blackjack at the pool side tables.  We chose the Golden Nugget for the new pool and their reputation for being a choice hotel.  It was nice but I give it 3 stars only because I don't have reason to stay again since my son was over swimming after an hour!  The valet service was a bit rude.

The naan was flat as a pancake and the filling was very bland.  Both entrees were large and delicious though the lamb was on the tough side. We concluded the meal with a shared portion of carrot halwa which was a bit too sweet.  \n\nService, other then by the busboy, was abysmal from start to finish.  The sole waiter, I am guessing the owner, sat in a booth across the room from us playing with a cell phone and never once looked in our direction to determine if we or any of the other diners needed anything.  I had to call the busboy over to get our check and then it took the waiter an inordinate amount of time to process the payment.",

The Pad Thai has a pretty mild flavor and the ingredients blend well together.  The curries seem a bit too sweet.  Also if you get it spicy, the heat doesn't seem to blend well with the sweet.  In other words, the sweetness of the curries overpowers the spiciness.  That being said, it's still pretty good.  And convenient.",

The crab legs did not taste fresh and the other dishes, I felt, were not cooked to please the palate. With world-famous chefs working at the Bellagio, I was quite surprised. I really can't remember a thing I enjoyed there. Maybe in the past this was a good place and the reason for the write ups, but I don't think that's the case any more. We actually enjoyed the buffet at Sunset Station a lot more. The food had a lot more flavor and had us wanting to go back again and again.",

I noticed most of the bad reviews were for larger groups - there were 6 in our party, but again who cares about excuses.\nMaybe we should've known not to go since it was a Friday night and only 2 tables were taken out of probably 15. But the name is so cute and it had generally good reviews on yelp.\nSo we went, had some overpriced $12 soju (retail $3) and everyone got all you can eat. The guy wouldn't let me start w kalbi and spicy pork - said no do the brisket because it cooks faster. That wasn't a suggestion he wouldn't let me start with what I wanted. They brought out the sides,like 4 things - more regular kim chee, radish, some kind of fermented fish and these cute little pancakes. The selection sucked I asked for cucumber kim chee she said we don't have that, soy sauce potatoes \"we don't have that\", more of the pancakes pls \"you only get one\" WTF! \nBrisket is done and they bring out another pile of kim chee and bean sprouts to cook. Its pretty obvious they were trying to fill us up with the cheap sh*t. They brought out kalbi finally when it was done we asked for more and we were told it was 1 order per person, which it does say in the menu. I told him no there are 6 ppl and the amnt you brought out was serving for 2 or 3. I didnt say it but F*ck that. He went to the back and brought out more. Yay....\nI asked for shik-hye for the end of the meal \"we don't have that\".\nEveryone on yelp said the best part was the fried rice they make on your grill. I was looking forward to this light at the end of a craptastic tunnel. The kim chee fried rice was ok, nothing special. We got the bill which wasn't itemized just a bunch of prices and a total, so we asked what everything was.  Those mofos charged us $4.95 x2 for that fried rice! Maybe this goes back to the not being Korean issue but I never saw a charge mentioned in any other reviews. \nWe paid and left w out leaving a tip. Not something any of us normally do, but that really was the worst dining experience I've ever had. I almost hoped they would come running out asking about a tip like I've read in other bad reviews on this place. \nMy suggestion - don't bother w honey pig! Go to woo che its in the same shopping center right off of spring mtn, its where we normally go for Korean bbq. Its cheaper, has other prepared food included, you pick what meat you want and cook what you want when you want it. Service is also very nice. This is what I get for trying something new",

I'd say so. Scrumptious. \n\nSome of that certainly has to do with the folks here at Straight From Philly being quite meticulous in its recreation of the original. Including the use of Amoroso-brand bread, that being what is apparently used in the originals. Now, don't ask me about the logistics of getting that bread from Philly to Henderson, because I don't know.\n\nWhat I DO know is that there's clearly a portion-to-price issue here. That being why I've only hit it about three times. A fairly-stuffed 8\" Cheese-Whiz Philly, $8. Add a side of Cheese-Whiz fries, add $3. Then a can of soda. With tax, that puts you pretty close to the $15 mark. And $15, with plenty of room to spare, is any of several awesome sit-down dinner plates with salad/soup and beverage just across the street at Village Pub. Or you could get by on a couple of slices of pizza and soda for about $7 at Pizza Heroes about 20 yards away. And Straight From Philly's pricing isn't likely to draw students from the high school across the street at lunch or after-school ... though Pizza Heroes probably will. (They won't be allowed into Village Pub.) And Pizza Heroes is DELIVERING their generously packed cold & hot subs, subs that compete in type and price with Straight From Philly's non-Philly offerings. \n\nAll that sort of leaves Straight From Philly in a volume & price-point no-man's land.\n\nWhile, as I said, their Philly is ever-so-tasty -- 110% satisfying if that is what you are craving -- I suspect these folk had better come up with some lunch-specials or 2-fer-bargains or soda-and-a-side-meal-deals or family-packs or some similar ideas, seen at so many fast-food & fast-casual concepts these days.\n\nThat is if they don't want end up having to go back to Philly.",

I picked out a sandwich and read the \"how to order\" section. Following the instructions, I ordered a Caprese (mozzarella, tomato, pesto) with balsamic vinaigrette and spinach. When I unwrapped my sandwich (at home), there was no tomato. My husband was similarly missing the sauerkraut that should have been on his sandwich. We also ordered the kids grilled cheese, which was made with the heel of the bread--that was a no for the toddler. It's not a good feeling when you feel like you know the menu better than the employees--and it's your first visit. Maybe for lunch, Which Wich is fine but not so much for dinner.",

The bartender was super friendly and since the menu board was behind us, he gave us a paper menu to see the beer selection.\n\nMore local bars should offer a beer selection like this place does. Can't be that difficult - and based off the crowd, it looks to be a good move on their part!\n\nWe didn't eat or play any of the games, so I can't comment on either of those things.

That being said, I kind of want to LIVE at Ramen Sora. \n\nMy choice for dinner was the miso ramen deluxe (large size, because hey, who am I trying to fool right?). The broth was divine. Such a complexity of flavor, and just enough to keep the soup-to-noodle ratio perfect. The noodles themselves were the consistency that ramen should be; slightly chewy and smooth and slurpable. The deluxe comes with charsiu, which is sweet pork. Sora's is thick-cut, very juicy and not at all dry like it is at some restaurants. Then there were pieces of nori (seaweed), menma (bamboo shoots), negi (green onion), and a boiled egg. The menu offers plain versions of the ramen dishes for those who prefer a more simplistic approach, but I enjoyed everything that was going on in that bowl. An order of gyoza accompanied my ramen, and I was completely full after that. \n\nOur table split the bill, and with our two large deluxe bowls, one super size deluxe bowl, and two orders of gyoza, the price came out to $15 each (including tip). Totally affordable and it sure did hit the spot. Save a table for me next time, Ramen Sora! I'll be back :)",

My first experience was in 2014 and I have been coming here almost every other month and as often as I can while living in Vegas.  Yes, that often and so worth every penny in my opinion.  Since moving away, every trip to Vegas now I have to visit at least once and purchase a large box macarons!  \n\nChef Mio is amazing with her creativity and patience.  She takes her time putting together her beautiful desserts as intricately as she possibly can.  English is her second language but she enjoys talking to her patrons to learn how they are enjoying their experience. \n\nDining here is more of an experience than just a get in and get out sort of place.  You must sit at the bar if at all possible, but if you're in a large party,  you'll be seated at a table.  The reason why you should sit at the bar is because the experience is like an art show.  You watch Chef Mio start from beginning to end and create a masterpiece through multiple steps.  I think just watching her assemble each plate is just as enjoyable as eating it.  Her desserts are definitely not for the average American because it is not heavy and overly sweet.  In my opinion, it is the perfect dessert to end a meal in Vegas.  \n\nWhat I like about Sweets Raku is that each season, they have a new set of desserts to reflect the ingredients of the season and often times rotate the popular items throughout the year.\n\nTea Selection - They have a limited selection of tea from Lupicia, which is a Japanese brand with very delicious fruity and floral tea flavors.  perfect to pair with the desserts.  My favorite is the supergrade oolong momo and the muscat.    \n\nThe kitchen is very cute and clean.  The bathroom, please visit the bathroom. It is so unique and quite fun to figure out how everything works.  \n\nService from the waiters is a hit or a miss.

Here's a chain location that get's it right!!!!\n\nJeni's offers a wide variety of flavors made in Columbus and shipped into Chagrin.

Then sample what you do like and order from there.\n\nI found a new favourite in Brambleberry Crisp ice cream, but everything I've tasted from Jeni's so far has been just splendid.  $4 for a double scoop is a bargain compared to the competition's offerings.  Especially considering that most people spend $4-5 for a coffee everyday next door at the Starbucks.\n\nThe worst part about this Chagrin Falls location is the crazy customers.  These folks don't know how to queue, they stare at the menu for seemingly hours and they still don't seem to know what they're ordering.\n\nOn the night of my first visit there was a line out the door.  Not because the place was great, but because the other customers were being typical idiots.

        "text": "After looking for a nice restaurant off strip for a group for lunch, we ended up at Pane Vino.  My local friends were thinking we would just have lunch at the deli, but to our surprise the main restaurant was open.  What a beautiful space!  Interesting curvy windows that face the strip and the airport.  The decor was warm and inviting.   Right in the middle of the restaurant is what appears to be a support pole but is a mosaic lady's leg, although I'm not sure you would realize what it was from a different angle.  I am sure at night this is a very romantic space (2 members of our group got engaged there), and it is definitely upscale.  Our party had just come from wine-making and we were casually dressed and a bit rowdy, but that didn't affect the service or our welcome one bit.\n\nIt's funny that the other reviewers mentioned the choice of napkins because I made comment to my friend that I loved them!  We all had white napkins, but they were so nicely textured and such high quality - okay I have a thing for linens - that I knew we were in for a treat.  The service was excellent and our 2 waiters had a great sense of humor, although we did not get the table dance we asked for, the cute blond waiter did do a little Irish jig for us!  \n\nThey had a nice variety of wines by the glass to choose from and reasonably priced at most under $10 a glass.  They brought out fresh breads served with a small dish of olive oil and topped with balsamic.  I had the linguine with seafood, mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops in a light and fresh tomato based sauce.  It was wonderful, especially the scallops that just about melted in my mouth.  Yum!  Nice sized portion, I didn't finish all the pasta, but there wasn't enough to take for later.  The dessert menu read like the best food porn, but we had homemade cherry port and chocolate brownies waiting for us at our friends, so we passed. \n\nIt was a great meal, with excellent service in a comfortable space - I can't wait to go back for dinner and check out the view as well.",

        "text": "Sorry Daddy, but you are Nacho my type.\n\nI have dined at the downtown Nacho Daddy location and I also attended a Yelp Elite event at this location.  I returned to this location shortly before 6 pm on a Tuesday with a friend who had never been to Nacho Daddy. \n\nDespite it being happy hour, there was not very many people dining and we were quickly taken to a large and comfortable booth to wait for our server. Personally, I felt like service was a little slow considering how empty the place was, but our waitress was very friendly.\n\nWe started out with margaritas which were excellent. No complimentary chips and salsa here, Daddy's a stingy one. \n\nSince there was a taco Tuesday special (3 for $5), we decided to share a plate of the avocado tacos that I thought were the standout item served at the Elite event. Sadly, these were not as light and crispy as I remembered and they were served drenched in salsa.  \n\nI had never ordered nachos from either of the Nacho Daddy locations I had been to, so it seemed fitting that we share some and we decided on the Filet Mignon Nachos. While the nachos are quite large and easily enough for two people to share, I found the ingredients to not be well dispersed and the ranchero sauce overpowered the other flavors on the plate. \n\nTotal damage for 2 margaritas, the tacos which were on special and a plate of nachos to share was over $50, pretip. While this is by no means overboard for a dinner on the Strip, I do think it was a bit high for what we actually received. \n\nI will keep Nacho Daddy in mind for the rare occasions I need a vegan-friendly spot to take guests for a meal. Personally, I don't foresee myself coming back for more than a margarita.",

She asked which kind. It was so loud that I used my hands to communicate. I put up 3 fingers trying to indicate the 3rd tap in and pointed inward because the 3rd tap in was the one I wanted. She proceeded to pour 3 beers because she tried to naively act like that meant I wanted 3 even though it was clear I was by myself but the odd thing was that she still knew to pour the 3rd tap in. If she knew it was the third tap in then how could she also think I wanted 3 when I was clearly alone. Place was empty and I was the only one near the bar. After she handed me 3, I laughed and put one finger up ( my middle one ) and said I only wanted one. She must've thought she was funny because she poured another. I laughed again and sat down with 4 beers. I've never been here and will never come back again. It's far into the ghetto part of Fremont but I paid for tickets to see a band I've been trying to see since they began. I hope that band never plays there again because it's a small stinky bad attitude kind of venue and I would not recommend going unless you are already a barfly here. In that case, have fun.\n\nRuined my night and was really disappointing because I made a special trip for this show.",

You can get wings, cheese fries, you can get Indian food, you can get Mexican food, and you can get Asian...it just feels lost. 1) The beer cheese fries were delicious. 2) The dry rub wings were overdone, wings burnt.  However, the buffalo wings were pretty juicy. And the wings are big and meaty which of course I liked. 3) The ahi tuna was pretty good but again just seems weird that it's on the menu. 4) The fish and chips were okay. The fish itself was better than the preparation. Tartar sauce was bland. But I guess you can get seafood here too? 5) The side of tikka we got was definitely not tikka...it was more like a yellow curry sauce.  \nThe worst thing was probably out waitress who we thought seemed like she might be high. She forgot to bring side plates so some other server brought them and then when our waitress brought them, we told her that but she shoved them on our small table anyway. \nAnd on a side note, we sat at a high top table at the bar and our chairs were very wobbly and not sturdy at all...I thought they might break.",

Still, they have tables outside.  I was seated there on my most recent visit.\n\nI love their chips and salsa and could eat it all day long.\n\nI've ordered a few different entrees and tacos from Joyride.  They were all pretty good.  On the most recent visit, I ordered a Garden Variety veggie burrito ($8)  sans the white magic (as it contains egg).  It was actually really good.  \n\nHowever, I have to say that the food is inconsistent in that the entrees have all been pretty good, but the sides and soup are just plain boring.\n\nI ordered the pinto beans on my last visit ($3) and ate two bites of the dish.  They seemed to lack any flavor and could have used, at the very least, some salt and pepper.  On a previous visit I ordered a bowl of the tortilla soup ($6).  It tasted like chicken noodle, at best.  It was not good and I sent it back (which I never do).  My dining companion ordered a side of \"The Bomb black beans\" and he only ate a few bites, when he normally inhales them.  I noticed a guy at a table in front of us ordered the side of rice.  I observed the guy ate one bite and left the rice untouched after that. \n\nMy daughter ordered the kid's meal nachos, which had some sort of fondue-like melted cheese on top.  The chips looked good, but she had fewer than ten nachos on her plate.  It came with milk and a side of some cut up fruit.  The tray had a place for another side and I think it should have had beans or something in addition for the $5 they charge.  Still, it would have been fine if my daughter would have eaten all the nachos. Unfortunately, we were seated under a tree and leaves kept falling into her food.  She refused to eat the food, even after I removed the leaves.  Unfortunately, we did not see our waitress often and it was too inconvenient to be moved at that point.  I would  ask to be reseated if the tree still had leaves (on a subsequent visit).  \n\nIf Joyride had more \"zippy\" or exciting sides, they'd have a loyal customer.  It's too darn bad they can't get better beans going.  I am still thinking about how good the veggie burrito is, but I won't be back unless someone else drags me.",

I come here often and always get discounted for bringing my own mason jar ( every location I have been to, including California), every single time. She told me that they only discount for their cup.

What we received was a honey bun sized cinnamon roll.  It was somewhat dry but tasty enough.  For that price, I expected something a little more interesting.  \n\nWhile I didn't partake, the bloody mary bar looks like a thing of beauty.  \n\nI ordered the quinoa burger and I get the direction they were going this with, but it needs work.  The quinoa/veggie patty was extraordinarily bland.  The goat cheese, onions and pea shoots weren't even close to enough to boost the flavor.  The fries were tasty.  \n\nMy husband did enjoy his fried chicken but did not care for his espresso cocktail.  \n\nFinally, service wasn't terribly good.  Our waiter walked past us multiple times while we were both sitting there not eating with our napkins on the table.",

I usually do take out for my family for dinner but they also have dine in and serve lunch. This place is usually packed with customers and people waiting for food orders. I love the Chinese greens with chicken, strings beans and beef or chicken. They also do a saut\u00e9ed of mustard greens with garlic, delicious. Salt and Pepper pork chops and great as well. The salt and pepper shrimp without the shell is a must have appetizer. On Cold days I love the Wor Won Ton soup or Hot and Sour soup. They are sooo good. This place is great if you have a big party or you need a place to celebrate with good food. I go so often they know me by name, lol. They aim to please here. I do miss my favorite waiter Alfred who is now retired. You will never be disappointed with this place. I think we eat here at least once a week for dinner.",

There were at least 5 staff members on when I got in, and it was 30 minutes before they closed. They were all very busy trying to get he store closed, despite the fact that there were at least a half dozen guests in the store at the time, and all of us had questions. \n\nThere was one grey haired gentleman who did a superb job at avoiding eye contact or any kind of interaction with the customers. \n\nI was able to get the attention of the girl behind the bulk counter to ask about their own sleep aids, and digestive aids since my partner has chronic gastritis. I got a couple of \"Uh-huhs\" a \"Yes\" or two, and when I asked about what was in the supplements, I got \"It's got a bunch of stuff in it to help you sleep.\"\n\n...\n\nI went ahead and purchased their products, and used their check in special (20% off of one Herbally Grounded Brand product). It wasn't a bad price, considering I also bought their heart health supplement (holy garlic!). \n\nI want to return sometime when they aren't focused on closing the store so I can see if I can pick their brains some more about their product.",

So we were expected to suck on these straws which now touched whatever else those bare hands touched prior to serving us??  We were appalled by this unsanitary service.

Very disappointed with the service and quality. The quality has been drastically decreased.  I've never seen my 10 year old not finish or complain about a slice of pizza before. Not even close to NY style pizza!

Being seated is quick, but then it takes forever to place the order and to get it and count yourself lucky to get a refill. I do want to say that all 3 times we've been we seemed to be in a slow section. The last time, 3 tables that were seated after us (in bigger groups) got their food first. We even ordered before 2 of them. So, I'm not sure if it's just been bad luck with our servers or what. All of this combined with runny chicken and dumplins' and small portions isn't really worth it.",

Reservations for 12 were made 3 weeks ago, confirmed 3 times, including earlier that morning for 8:30p on Saturday night. After waiting 30 minutes, 2 within our party had separately asked the hostess when we would be seated and received different excuses.  \n\nWith time to kill, I wanted to explore the other levels. The 2nd floor was closed. 3rd floor had the hookah lounge, and I sat down at the bar up there with louder house music in the background. I had a drink up there, a pretty weak gin and tonic for $5, with good service from the bartender. Came back down, we were still waiting. Finally seated at our 2 adjacent hibachi grills, 60+ minutes after our scheduled reservations. \n\nHoped things would be better ? No. \nWe waited several minutes for our server to arrive, received water and asked for drink orders. We ordered a $50 bottle of red wine, a couple mixed drinks, and sodas for the 6 at our table. 10 minutes pass and don't see our server. She arrived, sheepishly apologized, said couldn't find the bottle, we ordered another. At that point, I overhear a different server profusely apologizing  about the service to an adjacent table on the other side of us, stating he was working tables across 3 floors. I look over at the brewing conversion, make eye contact with one of the patrons at that table, and replies back \"you'll be screwed\".  \n\nWaited again for 10 more minutes with no sight of our server (at least the other server filled our water glasses as we grew restless), we had enough. 3 of us, 2 each with 5+ years in the industry went to speak to a manager. She apologized, and promised to bring one of the ordered bottles and to comp us a round of drinks. \n\nHighlight of the night: Incredulous, I ended up going to the Map Room, betting myself that I could finish a drink there before I'd receive mine at Tomo. I arrived at map room just in time to watch Kyrie win the final round of the 3point all-star contest, have a drink, receive great service, all within 10 minutes. \n\nI arrived back at Tomo, with my drink waiting for me for about a minute or 2; the other table still hadn't received their drinks yet (!) as the hibachi chefs arrive for each of our tables. \n\nOur chef itself was engaging and a nice, great guy, one of the only bright spots of the night. The food wasn't bad either, standard hibachi fare from what I've experienced going to hibachis once or twice a year. $20-$30 for a hibachi order of veggies, scallops, chicken, or salmon along with miso soup. Our other table didn't even receive their miso soup until their hibachi was already ! \n\nA hibachi along in 5 floors in a beautiful building would have been excellent addition to the Warehouse District. Unfortunately, this place just failed and gives Cleveland downtown dining a bad reputation.",

But if you order now, you can take it to go.\" Thanks to everyone's reviews I knew what to order.\n\nThe bulgogi quesadilla was very greasy. The fried kimchee had a layer of grease floating on it.

Menu is very simple, although you might have to ask what some of their stuff are but they are more than willing to educate you. On my first visit she asked me if we've been here before and then proceeded to explain their menu. Latti are their milk tea. Cotton candy is their shaved ice. It's in a small cup and it's pretty great. They have 4 flavors of that, and I've tried milk (condensed milk pretty much), coffee, and earl grey. I liked all of them. Will be trying their matcha flavor next time I'm in.\n\nTheir raindrop dessert is what's got all the people wanting to come in (at least for me) since it's so appealing visually. It's not anything to go crazy for, in terms of taste, but it's fun to get. The brown powder is roasted soybean powder, I believe, and depending if you get regular or green tea, that's their sauce. I've tried both and they're pretty decent.\n\nI've yet to try their Latti as all I've had was their hot jasmine green tea. So far so good for everything. Their tables are pretty small (and round) except for their one big table as you enter the cafe, but the seats are kind of spaced out.

Because I want to give a HUGE shout out to my server (insert name here).\n\nI had just come from eating apps at another restaurant up the street and when my dining companion got her scallops, well, let's just say my tummy wasn't all that happy with it's contents.  I was probably running to the restroom every 5 minutes or so.\n\nOur server (forgive me, but I didn't catch the name during my sprints to the loo) was awesome.  She gave me several bitters and ginger in an attempt to calm my stomach and offered some other options I could pick up at the drugstore.  Unfortunately, nothing worked, but the fact that she gave a damn how I was feeling was cool in my book.  Oh, and the bitters and ginger were really tasty...too bad they didn't stay down for long.\n\nAnyway, I can comfortably say these restrooms are nicely decorated...just wish I didn't have to spend all dinner there.",

It's dark, with minimal decor, and \"party\" style tables. The \"bouncer\" there was just chillin' at the bar, and the bartender was just as inattentive to any potential customers coming through the door.\n\nI went on a weekday at about 8 in the evening? The only people in there was a group that consisted of about 4 older Filipino men, I'd say around... hmm mid 30s to early 40s, and a bunch of young girls... somewhere around their 20s? Them,  and a middle aged couple. \n\nAnyways, I was having a good time with my 2 girlfriends, singing karaoke and such. I was stoked because I actually got the couple to slow dance when I sang \"Crazy\" by Patsy Cline. My friend Amber sang a Britney Spears jam, just so I wasn't hogging the mic... well, I was up there for the 3rd time, since uh, there was no one else in there, and our other friend, Maria didn't want to sing, then SUDDENLY, as I was approaching the last lines of \"I Will Survive\" by Gloria Gaynor the \"DJ\" cuts my song off, and decides to introduce one of the girls sitting with the Filipino Mafia, or whatever, saying she has a CD coming out. \n\nReally? Well, whatever... Perfect timing. Just when Amber was about to tip the DJ he cut me off.. NO MORE! Not since he pulled that stunt. \n\nSo I sat down with my friends, and we attempted to listen to this girl's supposed skills on the mic, and I have to say, I'm not the best singer, but I was definitely better than her. \n\nI'm giving this place one star, NOT ONLY for the horrible DJ, but for the horrible service, and UNDER SERVICED restrooms, not to mention the uncaring workers.",

SPICY SHRIMP\n-cherry peppers, mozzarella, eggplant, artichokes & chili oil\n*My husband ordered the special pizza of the night, which sounded like the spicy shrimp pizza that is on their menu today.  Now, my husband loves spicy.  He's a \"Caribbean jerk\" lover, Thai at a spice level of like 8/9, etc. He took one bite; his face turned red and he immediately started to sweat.  Whoa!  He took 2 more bites and he couldn't do anymore. It was drenched in red pepper flakes.  And so was the toilet after he made his way to the restroom. \n(-2 stars: too spicy and vomit)\n\nWe left and vowed never to go back.  Especially since the bill was $60+ for a bad meal.

We started off with drinks; I got Mexican Sprite (tasted similar to regular Sprite) and my friend got iced tea. I already know I wanted to order the brussels sprouts nachos from the rave reviews and my friend wanted guacamole so we ordered both. SO MANY CHIPS. I loved the nachos; the sprouts were charred and lots of flavor with the peppers, corn, cheese and the extra sauces they brought to our table. It was fun trying them all. Happy hour meant appetizers were half off, great deal.\n\nWe decided to also get shrimp tacos on flour tortilla and I thought it was delicious. You can choose corn or crispy tortilla and get rice and other sides with it for more money. Diego Pops doesn't do Taco Tuesday BUT they do have Taco Monday, which gets them twice the customers for those thinking they have special deals on Tuesday. \n\nOur server was friendly and funny and the place itself is cute. We sat outside as did most everyone else and they had heaters and candles to set the ambiance. I'd come back, they've got a good selection of items on their menu and food was tasty.",

Our waitress was new so we tried to be understanding but it was difficult when everything that could go wrong, did.  Not all of it was her fault though as the kitchen was extremely slow as well and everything was very unorganized.  Our first round of meats took forever so the grill was just sitting there burning and smelling of gas as we wait impatiently.  We asked for chopsticks and dipping sauces that didn't come until later.  She also brought only one sauce like we were supposed to share so we had to ask for another.  That never came so we asked again.  We needed refills of several things but didn't even bother.  Since everything took so long, we decided to put in another order ahead of time.  We were wondering why it never came until she came over and asked if we were ready for round 2 and we told her we already placed an order.  She said she can't put the order in until we were done but that it would come out quick.  She also did not let us order more than 2 at a time.  15 minute goes by as we sat and watched our grill burning black.  We've eaten at a lot of AYCE's and never heard of such thing.  Why would you let the grill sit there burning empty?  At this point we we lost our appetite and just wanted to be done.  As soon as the meats arrived, we asked for the check.  It took another 20 minutes.  As for the meats...not very good quality.  We will not be coming back.",

They also put hard pieces of asparagus in the dish. Unedible. The gluten free noodles, steamed rice and peanut sauce earned the extra star.",

        "text": "After a shiner beer dinner trip, a few hours at the bar trip, and a few just dinner trips - it's definitely a fully rounded review, but I'm pretty sure it would have sounded the same a few months back.\n\nThe food, is delish. The paco's taco (brisket) is just divine, as are both of the shrimp tacos. i think the campechana is awesome - and my mother (a ceviche expert) agreed. They have awesome food specials at the bar, and they have frito pie. (though I have yet to try it, the fact that it is on the menu makes me happy) Even their free chips and (both) salsas don't disappoint. They aren't perfect, and some items I've liked much more than others, but nothing has been \"bad\".\n\nNow to the important part - the booze. a lovely selection of shiner (two or three on tap and then a few bottled) and a (slowly) rotating selection of infused tequilas complete their full bar and tons of tequila. I'm a fan of the three-pepper infused one which tastes fab alone, in a bloody maria, or in their firestarter (or something to the same tune) margarita. oh, their margaritas - I've had a couple different ones and I like all of them, especially the one that's on special that night. \n\nWhat keeps this from being 5 stars is the service, and maybe a little of the ambiance. The amount of fajita plates ordered is ridiculous, and kind of makes me feel like I'm at Chili's. Not really their fault, I guess, but the constant sizzling and smoking can be distracting. The bartenders have always been great and friendly, but sometimes service has been a miss. In my book, there is a window for great service, but asking if I'm doing okay too many times in a certain time frame can be just as bad as never coming back to check in. I guess at Paco's I'm usually over-served(?), and more than once by a server who reaaaally shouldn't have chugged that second red bull right before her shift started. But hey, my water glass was continually filled to the rim, my drinks kept coming, and seconds after my food hit the window it was at the table - so I can't complain too much.",

The service needs to be improved, as when I asked what the status of the food was, the response \"the pastas take a while to cook. Should be bout soon.\" Mind I didn't ask her like, \"WHERE THE HELL IS MY FOOD?\" I was just asking for the status. I know I'm not obligated for an apology, but how it was said without it, just sounded justified like I was in the wrong. \n\nAnother one of the ladies asked if we needed anything else, I asked for a to go box since my girlfriend didn't finish her food. After waiting 10 minutes, I had to go up and ask them for a to go box. Why would you even ask us if you weren't going to get it anyway?\n\nService needs work, however their food is amazing. If you want to try this place out. I would definitely order to go so you don't feel obligated to tip. My girlfriend tipped 20% for two people and this is the service we got.",

The original restaurant on 7th Street, use to include \"in the Valley\" but I guess they're thinking bigger now, which is good.\n\nIn some Mexican restaurants, ambiance is everything.  Here it's just one more thing that makes you want to come back and enjoy their fresh food!  This restaurant is hard not to like.  When you come in, you feel as if you left a beach in Mexico (see photos), or SoCal. There are hardwood floors and a surfer feel to it.\n\nWhat can I say?  In America's Taco Shop, it's all about the Carne Asade!  \n\nWhether you order the Burrito, or the Quesadillas, what you will get is a home made flour tortilla filled with flavor,  We ordered both, along with their Trio of Tortilla chips, Salsa and Guacomole, and a soft drink and a Horchata.  If you haven't tried a horchata drink, try it here.  It's a mixture of rice milk and cinnamon with a hint of vanilla, and it's out of this world.\n\nThe food came out piece meal, with the chip Trio coming first.  The salsa had a little kick to it, but it wasn't too spicy.  The guacamole was tasty and well mixed, not chunky as in some places.  Just as we were starting to make a dent, out came the rest of the food.  \n\nThe tortillas on the quesadilla and burrito were both flaky and fresh.  There was a fair amount of pico de gallo and guacomole, along with some caramelized onions that mixed well with the carne asada.  Each did not overwhelm the other and it produced  a nice layering effect.  Very tasty!\n\nThe bill came to around $22 bucks, including tax and a couple bucks for the tip jar.  As we were leaving, we noticed that they had the Mexican delicacy of corn on the cob, brushed with mayo, cotija cheese and served on a stick.  \n\nWow!  Horchata and fresh corn, what does that tell you about how authentic a Mexican restaurant America's Taco Shop is?\n\nKeep in mind that ATS has a Happy Hour which runs M-F from 3-6pm and all day Saturday and Sunday -- which has many items for $1, $2, and $3, including a 16 oz. Margaita, as well as a Tres Amigos Tequila for $3.00.  You can also sign up for their eClub and get their Trio for free.\n\nWe left stuffed, with our taste buds tingling for more.  Well, until next time then.\n\nVery impressive, watch out Chipotle!",

It was their goldfish racing night, and the concept had proven moderately entertaining at Monkey Pant's over in Tempe where I had experienced this previously. However, at this dump they give two complete losers (guys who looked like they were on the 10 year plan at ASU) live mics so that they can degrade the crowd. Now, I understand the concept of involving your audience and taking a few jabs at them here and there for comedic purposes, but these assholes were no comedians, nor were any of their comments particularly funny. The terms \"lewd\" and \"disrespectful\" come to mind first, and after making numerous comments about my girl and her sister, we decided to leave. No wonder half the reviewers report that there were no hot girls at this place. Apparently, witnessing the behavior of these cretins gave a pair of creepy old white trash knuckleheads in the crowd the idea that they too should throw out a few sexually aggressive and completely inappropriate comments towards our girls on the way out, which almost resulted in a beatdown that probably would have cost me some jail time had some staff members not intervened. The fact that any business would encourage this kind of behavior on behalf of their employees makes me hope that one day, this shitbox will burn to the ground. A douchebag who doesn't happen to be dressed in standard uniform (i.e. tacky Christian Audigier shirt, overpriced \"designer\" jeans, and sunglasses indoors at night) is still a douchebag.",

My order was sixty dollars and change, so yes we were expecting great food. It took a while and we understood the wait, that wasn't our complaint. Once we got the three bags that completed our order I noticed that something had opened, was heavy leaking or it might of been a mistake. We opened the bag and it was grease spilling out three burritos. It wasn't just like a teaspoon like but a lot. Exaggerated like and it was so disappointing to see that. So we opened the other two bags and the food looked so greasy with grease sitting in the to go plates. I got the cashiers attention as I was still by the window.  I asked her and showed her then her response was to get the cook.  The cook came up and said the meat is in water (its juice) and of course it's going to come on your food.  He said he can drain it but can't remake it. Told him that we wanted a refund and said that all sales were final. We argued a little then drove off, couldn't believe we just wasted $60. and change.

Unfortunately this year was not a repeat.   Here is the blow by blow...\n1. My wife discovered the bathroom had no soap... mind you this was at first opening. \n2. Service.  We were the first table seated, and was done so immediately at opening. Water and menus presented at seating.  After that the waiter disappeared for an extended time. Other guests had their orders taken quickly. In terms of service, our entrees came out about 20 minutes behind other guests... remember, we were literally the first ones seated. I finally had to ask about the status? Generically, the attention vs last year was night and day different.\n3. Food: my wife had a Parmesan chicken dish., like last year. Presentation was AMAZING. It came with a lemon cream sauce, but the chicken was literally floating in it. She asked for a separate plate to drain off the excess.  The lemon was also a bit overpowering.  Last year I had the filet, but asked for a recommendation on the rib eye. He recommended a dry aged one. It was cooked nicely, but was a bit tough. Personally, I would stick with the filet. I also had the lobster tail, which was delicious, but at $85 was shockingly small. Independently, my wife observed how small it was...seemed at least 1/3 smaller than last year, and more expensive!!!\n4. Lastly, my only issue last year, was the refill on a very small coke was another $5 like the first glass..... for 25 cents of soda, you are going to charge me ANOTHER $5? Restaurant responded here last year that they would address with management... I checked... still $5 for a refill.... on a $300 dinner...?? Waiter agreed it did not make sense. \nUnfortunately, we will likely be looking for another great Vegas spot to have our 47th anniversary.  Bookmark removed.",

Went at 10pm on a Friday night, wasn't horribly packed so it wasn't too hard to find a table. They have foosball, shuffleboard, darts, billiards, just to name a few, to play (for free). There's also a bowling section that is ~$10-12/hr/person. We ordered the peanut fries (I know, weird sounding, right??), Lobster & bacon fries, cheeseburger, and fried chicken sandwich (this isn't the real menu name). Both the peanut and lobster & bacon fries were delicious. Combinations of ingredients you would never expect to be together, but absolutely delicious. Highly recommend. Both the burger and fried chicken sandwich were tasty, and a good size. What really solidified this meal-- the onion rings. O.M.G. The best onion rings I've ever had in my life. I don't know what they do to make them so amazing, but I could eat buckets of them!! We also had to coleslaw as a side-- also delicious. It's not a traditional cabbage and dressing coleslaw, but sooo much better. It was mostly brussel sprouts, and wow, was it tasty. They've done a really great job of taking basic bar food and making it really, really unique. I will come back here just for the onion rings!! Our service was excellent.",

Once seated, we were pleasantly surprised that they had late night happy hour.  However, the one ramen bowl on the HH menu was out.  We went for their shrimp balls on the HH menu to start.  For my ramen, I went with their Jinya Chicken with added corn and spinach noodles instead.  The Jinya Chicken consisted of chicken broth instead of pork base.  It also had bean sprouts, green onions, chili, spinach, and chicken.  I also asked for some black garlic oil on the side.  It was still a little bland so I added some of their gyoza sauce to give it more flavor.  I wish they had vinegar instead.  It was very good and super filling.  As for the shrimp balls, we had ask the waitress how big they were.  They were a LOT bigger than what she told us.  They were good though.  Extra crispy on the outside and filled with lots of delicious shrimp pieces inside.  It came served on a spicy mayo sauce.  We couldn't finish them.  \n\nOur total was about $25.  I thought pricing was very cheap and reasonable.  The bowls all run about $11 each and any additional add-ons, such as corn, is another $1.  The service was excellent.  The girl waiting on us was very bubbly, sweet, and knowledgeable.  The food came out fast.  The inside of the restaurant is small but cute.  It has an urban vibe, which I like.  Overall, it's a solid ramen house that I would come back to.",

Also for dessert, we ordered their popular dessert Bibingka Souffl\u00e9. \n\nKare Kare: was very pricey but it had big chunks of oxtails in it good for three people. Flavor was good and loved the idea of the Sliced grilled vegetables on the side.\n\nPork Belly w/ Eggplant: Amazing! Felt like I never had this kind of Filipino dish before. Really juicy and tender with the mango and eggplant to balance the flavor. Great recommended choice ! \n\nGarlic Rice: instead of getting white rice I suggest getting the garlic rice for a couple dollars more. Good to feed about 3 people as well. \n\nBibingka Souffl\u00e9: never had it, but I'm glad I tried this time. The texture is just like a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The hint of salted egg was surprisingly good. \n\nGreat staff and great food do come by if you get the chance.",

I was looking for somewhere for pasta and my best friend recommended this place since it was close to where we wanted to stop by for dessert. I've only been to Oregnao's once, quite a bit ago, and I had a pasta bowl that was waaay to dry for my liking. I decided to give the company another try.\n\nI ordered the bollo pasta.. if that was the correct name for it. It's just plain spaghetti. It came with angel hair and I didn't see any normal spaghetti pasta on the menu so I settled for it. My mistake because it really gives your pasta a different taste. It kinda mushed together in one bite and the texture was kind of off-putting. I ordered it with meat sauce and I literally got NO meat in my dish. Maybe like 4-6 pieces out of the ENTIRE portion that could feed 2-3 people. The sauce is completely chunky, meaning it was only really diced tomatoes (which is fine if you like that) but because of that, no sauce got on the rest of the angel hair, making the dish super dry. The tomatoes just stuck to chunks of angel hair. The dish was just CHUNKS of tomatoes and there was BARELY any sauce or meat! I felt pretty ripped off since I paid extra (granted it was like two bucks but I had to get more sauce because it was really just a chunky paste). Needless to say, my craving was never settled. \n\nThat makes 2/2 for a meh experience at Oregano's and I'll hit somewhere else for pasta from now on since I've given them two tries. Server was nice though (Kristen I believe). No complaints about their customer service. She was working hard as she looked like the only waitress in the section. She was still attentive and friendly to everyone despite how busy it was. \n\nAlso to add, the location was very small and kind of tight so you would entire from the front door, walk to the back OUT the restaurant to claim a table with a host, and go back inside the restaurant because it's pretty small.",

The decor is fun with spinning flowers dangling above the dining area and fun pictures to admire on the walls.\n\nFor my entree I decided on the fried chicken breast and waffles while my mom and fella both opted for different versions of the chilaquiles. As a last minute decision we ordered a pot o bread when we saw a bunch of them come out of the kitchen for another table, tempting us. \n\nService was slow to start, but I cut them some slack since they just opened and are finding their groove. It got better and more attentive as the meal progressed. \n\nOur food came out and the portions were enormous, making me wish we had shared. My chicken breast eclipsed my waffle on my plate and I wish they had not places the chicken on top of the waffle since the heat seemed to make the waffle limp and a little mushy. The flavor of the waffle was good but the chicken wasn't as good as I expected. It was cooked well but the flavor of the batter seemed off. It had a spicy kick but still seemed very bland and had a starchy aftertaste that I didn't care for.\n\nMy mom and fella raved about their chilaquiles and after sampling them I can't say I agree. The temperature seemed a bit on the colder side and the cheese wasn't entirely melted. The steak that came with my fella's meal was a little over cooked and the seasoning was a bit overdone. He loved his dish, so I guess that's all that matters. The pot of bread was awful, I don't recommend this at all. It was dry and flavorless. I took a bite and left it alone. \n\nOverall, the service was good and the food was hit and miss. My family loved the meal so we will likely be back, but I will be sure to sample a different dish next time and hope for the best.",

You walk inside to a dimly lit bar and there is a basement with barrels and chairs--where live music is played on weekends.  We were immediately greeted by someone and given a list, the tasting explained. You pay $10 for the first 6 wines on the list, $15 if you want the last reserve.  If you buy a bottle, the cost of the tasting is waived.  The attendant was good at explaining their wines, the process, the grapes, etc.  There were small portions of crackers and thinly sliced cheese between 1 oz servings.  I had the sangria, which was a nice balance of sweet and fruity, served chilled with ice.   It was a basic experience, and we had fun chatting and joking around with the man serving us.  More customers came in as we were finishing, so this place has a steady crowd it seems.  I think this is a place to explore later in the day, to see what the music scene is about.  The wine was good, their list simple--not a lot for a sweet wine drinker like myself.  All-in-all, it was a good experience, and I we learned some things.  It's a nice change from the grocers and cafes on the Strip.",

The food took an insanely long time, especially considering the fact they did not have a full house. Two out of four of our orders came incorrect even though the changes were simple, and there seemed to be little to no remorse or regret about this. The only reason they are not getting one star is because the food was okay AFTER being remade but there was still barely any mushrooms which is what took them over an hour to get onto my sandwich. But don't waste your time, there are too many good restaurants in that whole mall area to risk a bad experience here. I recommend Gordon Biersch.

Anniversary dinner for the main reason that their menu shows that they focus on healthy eating and the foods change with the seasons. When we arrived we were greeted and sat down right away. The ambience this location has is so warm and comfortable, within minutes we had water at our table and a welcoming waitress asking what she can get us to drink. I stuck with water but my wife and our friend got a beer and I ordered the salt and pepper shrimp as our appetizer.

The waitress was so friendly and was quick to answer all the questions we had after bringing our drinks back. As we were getting ready to order the shrimp arrived and they were so delicious, They were perfectly seasoned and fried. I ordered the Cajun ribeye and it did not disappoint!!! I absolutely loved it. It was cooked to perfection and so juicy. For dessert we got the Ice cream on top of this cake thing... HAHAHA, don't know what it was called but I pretty much ate the whole thing. I gave my wife a bit and luckily our friend didn't want to try it which I was ok with because it meant more for me. The restaurant has warm and comfortable vibe to it, you can be dressed up or casual and it feels right either way. The cost wasn't that bad either for the amazing food we had!! Usually for healthy option restaurants you have to accept youll have to pay for what you get, in my opinion we got a smoking deal!!!

If you want anything else in the world, don't go here (they have other menu items, but nothing that can't be beat elsewhere).\n\nI will give a special mention of their beverage selection.  Pretty good unsweetened iced tea sits next to a fountain with multiple Boylan brand (whoops) sodas.  Better than your normal soft drink offerings.\n\n(Oh, and because you have to basically go down the counter with someone as he or she makes your salad, I think it would be a hard place to go with groups, since there will be substantial lag in between the times the first and last people receive their salads--though it's not as big a problem as it would be at other restaurants, since you don't have to worry about your salad getting cold.)",

On the same day, I found an article about this shop in Ohio City and decided to look at its menu. What did they have? Korean fried chicken AND ramen! This place serves old school korean fried chicken, the skin is not crispy whereas the modern KFC 2.0 has very thin and crispy skin.\n\nWe each ordered a noodle dish I got ramen and we shared a boneless KFC. When our noodles came out, we were so hungry and took care of that first before wondering where our appetizer was. The dish was very salty, I got the dipping ramen so it made a bit more sense that the dipping soup would have a stronger flavor. I'm not sure if it is supposed to be this way for dipping ramen, but I am very used to eating ramen very quickly while it is still hot. That is the way I have always learned and known to eat it, but this was certainly not your most authentic quick bite hot ramen shop. Nonetheless, it satisfied a craving and was quite good!\n\nWe finally got around to asking about the fried chicken and our waiter apologetically made an order, realizing he had forgotten to. We were not upset at all, but he still took it off the bill. We cleaned that entire dish so quickly and I was pretty happy. The food respectively though is a bit more on the more expensive end for ramen, but it is unique and special.\n\nI really recommend the service, and intimate space at this restaurant!

That didn't bother us, but once we sat we were admonished to get up until someone has been able to clean it up.  So, we stood and waited for a several minutes, despite the fact that it was early and relatively slow, before deciding to just grab a table inside instead.  I ordered a beer - it was lukewarm.

While still eating, I needed to feed the meter outside and asked change a $5 bill for some quarters, only to be told \"we don't make change for the meters\"... OK, that's weird.  Fortunately, the bartending was willing to help me out from his tip jar.  We'll still come back, and hopefully our next experience and review will be better.",

We were asked multiple times by the people cutting the meat if we wanted a specific cut, and within 3 minutes he was back cutting it for us! 5 Star Service through and through! Sign up for their eClub our bill went from $74 to $43 TOTAL FOR TWO for lunch due to being able to use 2 coupons for the table according to the fine print!

Couldn't find the name of it online but we got the curry/coconut broth chicken soup for 2 with level 3 spiciness (\"Adventurous\") and it was incredibly satisfying. I'm not a huge mushroom fan so I picked them out but boy was that broth and tender chicken enough for me! I got the Larp (minced pork) with \"Careful\" level spice. It was good, but disappointing for me because  it was packed with cilantro, which I HATE and for some reason I always forget to ask for dishes without it. I wish I loved cilantro. It's in every good dish. Sigh. Anyway, my friends got the Stuffed Chicken and the Mango Curry and they loved their dishes even at the  \"Native Laotian\" top level spiciness! We went on a Tuesday night and they were understaffed so service was slow and they didn't seem to really care. Whateva!

        "text": "Hello Las Vegas!  I'm Nette B. of Nette.Yelp.Com and I dined at your restaurant.  \n\nI'll give the disclaimer now.  I've been to really good hot pot restaurants and unfortunately Chubby Cattle is just meh.  I've had hot pot in San Diego and Hawaii and my palette desires good tasting food.  \nIf you've never had hot pot then to you this is good. For me?  Meh... It's alright. \n\nWe came here for my birthday dinner.  My choice while in Vegas so I can introduce my family members to Mongolian Hot Pot.  We made reservations for a table of 6 at 8pm on February 1, 2019. \nWe arrived at 10 minutes to 8pm and our table was not ready so we waited a few minutes. We opt for the individual pots so that everyone in my party would have their own choice of broth.  \n\nDISCLAIMER: Individual  small pot is not served in the ying yang pot.  Boo!  Other places I've been has the split pots for smaller individual. I will say that having tables with individual small pots is a great idea.  \n\nOur server was Deni.  He was nice and he tried to recommend and upsell us on some platters etc.  I think they only one we fell for was the basket of vegetables in which we didn't eat it all and ordered extra baby bok choy instead.  We should've stuck with our gut and order 2 large bok choy.  He also tried recommending the oxtail broth and only 1 person in our party ordered that and she was not pleased.  She took the spicy hot broth from another person to add more flavor. \n\nI personally ordered the entry level hot.  Three people ordered the medium hot and they LOVE spicy 10 hot at thai restaurants and they were saying it was really hot & spicy where they were sweating.  LOL but still liked the broth.  I, on the other hand was thinking OMG this is extremely hot.  I scooped up a lot of red peppers in my pot.  See how red my pot in my photo.  But I pressed through and enjoyed my meal.  I had to ask to add more mild broth so calm the heat down.  Demi didn't come by to do that when I asked that I had to flag down another server who kindly filled my pot for me.  Also, we had to ask for our waters to be refilled.  :(  \n\nFood: \nA lot of pork belly since I can eat 2 plate fulls for myself. :) \nBasket of vegetables\nRib Eye \nMussels \nTofu \nSquash from the conveyor belt\nand noodles.  \n\nSo, the noodles are made in house.  If you are used to egg noodles then I would recommend the tomato noodles.  They have different flavors and they also offer a basket of noodles.  Blah, not happy with the noodles also.  I had to dip it in my soy sauce I created.  Speaking of created, there's a sauce bar where you walk up to in the middle of the restaurant when you enter and you make your sauce.  I used vinegar and soy sauce.  Others used the ponzu and garlic etc.  I was pleased with my sauce but the area looked a bit dirty and no one was cleaning it up to make it look presentable.  \n\nAt the end we spent about $200. Not bad prices but the broth prices are a bit pricey.  $6.99 for the oxtail broth.\n\nI would return again If I desire Hot Pot in Vegas.  But my go-to would be in San Diego and Costa Mesa where the Hot Pot's are more desirable.  \nNot bad but also not the best.  Lastly, I spoke to another friend who lives in Vegas who agreed with my feedback.  \n  \n#nette.yelp.com\n#YelpBlackElite",

We came during restaurant week because I've been dying to make it out that way- and what better time?\n\nI'll start by saying that the staff is incredible. The host, our server, everyone was warm and welcoming. \n\nThe restaurant week menu consisted of a potato appetizer, a steak, and a chocolate dessert. There was also a \"specialty\" drink for restaurant week. \n\nTo start, the rule was if one of us ordered the restaurant week menu, everyone at the table had to order it as well. Like, what? How is that even a thing- and if it is, why is that not mentioned in their restaurant week advertising? What if I just drove my vegetarian friend 35 mins, and now no one can order any restaurant week foods because there is only one option and it's meat?\n\nThe steak was chewy and gross - even my husband wouldn't finish mine. The potato appetizer ended up being the highlight. Such a disappointment.\n\nThen, they are out of their specialty drink- okay, there is a replacement and it sounds decent. End of the story is that I paid $11 for a substitute drink that was basically water with a slice of pineapple.\n\nOnly cool part was the friendly staff and the fact that they display the record of the music that is playing at the time.\n\nI was so angry that I got fancied up, drove all the way across Pittsburgh, only to be disappointed.",

I would actually give this place more like 2-1/2 stars. I liked the tofu and pork clay pot we ordered. But the pork and kabocha squash dish was waaaay too salty. I feel like it was a spice, not MSG, that was the culprit. Either way, I had to scarf down a lot of water every time I ate some. We also had fried green beans with XO sauce, which is pretty simple to make. I know they have a buffet too and judging by what I saw during my stroll, the food seemed like nothing special. I did crack up at the using a tortilla container for the steamed rice. \n\nI could see myself going here if I was really craving Chinese food for dinner or lunch. But I'd get it to go rather than eat it there. The inside is the usual old-school Chinese restaurant decor with booths and tables. As someone from the Bay Area and who grew up in a Chinese household, I could definitely say I've had better. I know the owner is supposedly a chef with 30 years experience so who knows, maybe I went during an off day.",

I just dont understand that type of service for lunch takeout! What is the delay? The DNC isn't here yet, we called ahead, she took her time to drive there and she still spent MORE THAN HER LUNCH BREAK waiting on the food to be prepared! So disappointing.\n\nThis treatment is unacceptable. It is not my fault I was told one thing, showed up and then told another thing (wait longer). They could have told me from the beginning, \"this will take 1 hour to prepare,\" and I would have shown up an hour later. COME ON!!!\n\nNOT ONLY THIS! She called to speak to the manager and some girl lied to her saying she was the manager on the phone when she knows from being in the restaurant the manager is a guy (the same girl told her so). The fake girl manager hung up on her when she asked to speak to the real manager. (Um?) Terrible terrible service.

        "text": "I've been to Church Brew Works several times and will say it was very impressive on my first visit. However, each visit after I was less and less satisfied. First of all, it is a spectacle to see. The Church itself and stain glass decor is beautiful. The brewing equipment on display at the alter is in plain view and for anyone into brewing it is fun to look at. I mean, they turned a Church into a brewery!  If you are even remotely curious, I suggest you at least go for a drink and look around.\n\nSpeaking of drinks, that was my main draw as my love for craft beer put a big bullseye on this destination. The first visit I did a flight which had their standard 6 or 7 beers like Pious Monk and Thunder Hop along with a rotating tap or 2. I believe the flight had 8 decent size samples for $13 or so. Now that first visit was great and I took all of the beers in. After a few more visits I can say that only the Pious Monk and Thunder Hop are memorable.  The rotating tap is usually decent but the rest is not very good for my tastes. I enjoy IPAs and full body beers. These to me lack flavor and just come off as average domestics.  No complexity and watered down.  If I go back I will stick with what I know I like and see what the rotating tap is. You can get growlers to go for a very reasonable price which I've done before.\n\nOne nice summer day I was in and sat on the patio which is very nice and enclosed with flag decor. I ordered a Dark N' Stormy (dark rum and ginger beer over ice with lime) and I must say it is the best thing I have ever had at Church Brew Works!  And the best Dark N' Stormy I've had anywhere. I don't know what they do but they should keep doing it.\n\nThe food much like the seating is split into two distinct categories. Pub side and Dinner side. Pub is more traditional bar foods and is cheaper where Dinner is more upscale and a jump in price. I generally go for Pub side seating on the left (dinner to the right) along with that menu since it's usually a quick stop for drinks. I've had dinner as well but in my opinion it is all small portioned and very bland though the presentation looks very nice.  The last few times I've gone I have skipped food all together.  I should also mention that they have oven baked pizzas but again, small and bland. But they look nice.  I'm just not impressed by the food options verse price compared to other breweries I've been to.  \n\nThe service has always been top notch and friendly. The place is clean and huge so there is hardly ever a wait unless you have a big group. It is definitely somewhere you should check out for yourself and make a decision. Worthy of a trip just to say you've been there and see the spectacle but there are better brewery choices in the area.",

The only fish I wasn't too fond of was the fried calamari. It's a little pricey but if you're in the mood to splash then this is a great place to do it!",

The ambiance seems cool, it has good reviews, and it's a block away.  \n\nWe ordered wings (mustard BBQ sauce), shrimp tacos, and herb fries. The wings were cooked well but dry and relatively flavorless. The sauce was too thin and tasted like it was made hastily or, worse, came from a generic bottle. The tacos weren't good either. The shells seemed poorly made and had an odd aftertaste, my friend said. The fries were great. Nice balance of crunchiness, saltiness and flavor. I don't think I would go back. Most of the food was a miss, the cocktails were good and the service was great. But that's just not enough.",

The drink came out in a larger size and rather quickly, oh gosh! Tbh, it wasn't as good as 7 Leaves because they add pandan to it and TS&C had a more grainy-bean texture to it from the blending of Mung Bean. Which at least is indicative that they use real mung bean in their drinks, just wish it was a tad bit sweeter and filtered a bit more finely. The pearls were cooked well, but not as sweetened as I had hoped.\n\n4 stars for even carrying Mung Bean MT (seriously, try to find a place that does ... then PM me), great workers, fast service and cheap prices for boba. Their menu is also looking a bit extensive which means tons of variety! Plus, when you're done with the boba there's coffee and snow left to try too!",

A group of friends decided to go and try it out since all we have been hearing about was that the trash can nachos was something we absolutely needed to try. So we decided to go and before you know it we had a group of 10 people! (We roll deep!)Lol!\n\nThis place is located inside the Rio hotel and Casino, not far from the main entrance. It opens at 5pm and closes at 11pm so if you want to try it out, plan accordingly. The restaurant it self has a good vibe, and has a lot of cool decor on the walls and has a cantina style feel. I want to give you guys a heads up and tell you about the attire, this place has big window walls that over looks the pool area so don't be caught off guard if you see guest in there with shirts, and bathing suits. I'm not gonna lie, that one threw me off guard just a  bit since your use to the no shoes, no shirt, no service policy in many places but what the hey right, it is Vegas and it is the Rio!\n\nNow, the good stuff, the food! The trash can nachos we came for, the reason for being at the Burro Borracho! The larger size Trash can nachos will cost you $32 you have a choice of meats which are on the Menu. It is suppose to feed up to 5 people....yeah well if your a Yelper it will feed two people! The trash can nachos were good, it was more of the fact that they were presented to you in a Large tin can which makes the experience cool, and different. To be honest you can probably go to a mom and pop shop and get the same quality for a whole lot less. \n\nThe desserts that were ordered look like good portions, and those were something two people could share. I didn't actually taste them because I was too full for desert but they looked very pleasing, the churros looked good, as did the deep fried ice cream.\n\nOver all a good, and fun experience at the Burro Boracho.",

Tonight we arrived at 5.45pm and were seated directly. By 6.30pm there was a slight wait, but that's not an issue as you can have a glass of wine or beer at their wine bar. We shall return and surely recommend to friends.",

They do serve their drinks from cans you grab from the cooler, BUT at least the cans are fairly priced t 99 cents! I can rattle off plenty of places that only serve cans, but gouge the *&^% out of you at $2 or $3 a can! Not here.\n\n\nThe sandwich does come with a choice of a side and I chose Mac and cheese (of course). The mac and cheese was alright, if not spectacular. It was the creamy variety, but in a relatively modest portion.\n\nThe dining/ sitting area is deceptively large and spacious. Plus there  are a handful of TV's with CNN, ESPN, etc playing for your entertainment. \n\nPrices are competitive. Not cheap, but not too bad either.\n\nI enjoyed my first experience here and will definitely be back. I am anxious to try some of their cold sandwich selections as well.

Our party was pretty bothered on how the male host handled our seating which kind of ruined everything. My father can't walk very well and has a hard time keeping his balance as he has a medical condition with his foot. When we go out we request booth seating near the entrance. This is always accommodated anywhere else we go but seemed to be a problem here. I went inside first and advised the host that we need a booth close by the door due to a medical condition for someone that couldn't walk very far. I noticed booths open directly behind the host area that would've been perfect. He seemed annoyed at my request and flat out told me \"no that section is closed you'll have to sit over here at this table\". Which if you've been in this chili's you know the tables are set up in a way where your chair is pretty much back to with the next tables chairs so not much room and he's a tall guy. This really didn't make much sense to me when there were still 2-3 parties seated in the supposed closed section and it was only 8pm on a Saturday night so it's not like it was nearing closing time. There were 3-4 booths available and it was literally 15-20 feet away at most from the next \"section\". Even if it was closed you couldn't have at least tried to make the accommodation given the circumstances? I wanted to make an issue of it but he's the type that doesn't want to start trouble so I had to bite my tongue while he sat at a cramped table to eat uncomfortably the whole meal.",

And if you do use cheese that dries up after being melted at least distribute it evenly all all the chips so that there isn't a lonely dry chip on the plate. \n\nI was impressed with the size of the Steak Nachos.  I was excited to dig into it.  When I grabbed one chip, it was stuck on to multiple chips that had cheese \"melted\" on.  Right then I knew this meal was going to go down hill.  \n\nThe Nacho Cheese was cold and so was the Steak.  I think the Steak should have been hot, right?  I mean, how do you screw up Nachos?  It tasted like our food was sitting on the counter for a while before it even got to us.  \n\nI asked the waiter for a side of the Nacho Cheese because there were so many chips that didn't get cheese.  It wasn't until she brought us a side of cheese that made this bearable to even enjoy.  The Nacho Cheese was HOT!  The way it should have been when it came out. \n\nSo with that being said....

My mouth was watering thinking about a nice thick juicy burger. Wrong! The only thing juicy was the lettuce and tomatoes. I opened the burger to discover a 3 1/2 inch diameter, thin wafer of meat, dry as a bone. Some parts I could actually see through. It was thinner than McD's. 1/8th pounder? I couldn't even taste it. I think you need to order the triple to taste the meat. By the time we got home (5 min.) the cheese on the FF's congealed into one big glob. I ate it cause I was still hungry after the burger. I ate it like a potato pancake. It was unappealing but tasted OK. My son liked his meal? \nI would go to BK's, McD's or Pete's any day of the week at 1/3 the price. Sorry son!",

        "text": "I'm not one to harsh on an employee who's just doing their best, but this Dunkin' Donuts gets one star for several reasons. One star from me is rare since I'm usually pretty easy going an forgiving, however here are the reasons for the single star.\n\nReason 1: Upon checking in on the Yelp app on my Android phone there was an offer for a cup of coffee for $0.99. The store lead, Steven, looked at the Yelp offer and said he could only provide that price if there was a barcode for the offer. Since there wasn't he said he couldn't do anything for me. Really? Aren't you in charge of the store? How come Uncle Dunkin' didn't give you full authorization? Dunkin' Donuts needs to get their act together regarding their partnership with Yelp and check-in offers.\nReason 2: The donut selection at this location was pretty sad. There were just barely 20 different donuts to choose from and each donut cost $1.09. If you head to a regular mom/pop donut shop, the selection is always larger and the cost per donut is also cheaper, typically around $0.60-0.70.\nReason 3: I ordered a chocolate and rainbow sprinkles donut because I like chocolate and the rainbow sprinkles are because I'm in touch with the kid in me. Anyhow, as you can see from my photo, Dunkin' was pretty stingy with the chocolate glazing. Less chocolate means less adhesion for sprinkles which means less sprinkles which then means more savings to Dunkin's bottomline on sprinkle costs. All this yields unhappy Ben.\nReason 4: My buddy ordered a breakfast sandwich and after waiting 13 mins we asked the counter what the status of his sandwich was. Their response was that they simply forgot. The shop only had 3 other people inside (besides our party of 4) all of whom were already finished eating or eating their orders therefore the employees being super busy isn't particularly valid.\n\nC'mon Dunkin' Donuts, step up your game or you'll go down in shame! \n\n(I'm kind of proud of this rhyme)",

There were several large parties at the restaurant and they seemed to be sucking the wait and cook staff away from attending to us. It took at least 10 minutes for someone to take a drink order, although the support staff filled our water very regularly and were easily the most attentive staff there.\n\nBeyond the service, the Spanish tapas were disappointingly mediocre. Having lived in Spain previously, I was really hoping to find a high quality tapas restaurant in Charlotte and thought the food was very average and definitely overpriced. The pimientos rellenos were the only truly outstanding dish out of the twelve we tried. The classic tapas like croquetas and patatas bravas were fine but nothing great. DO NOT order the espinaca catalana - very disappointing.\n\nI will say that my group of six each ordered two tapas and had plenty of food to go around. I enjoy the sharing style and it worked well at Malabar. We were all quite full at the end, I just did not feel like the quality matched the price here.",

Now, either we've grown more sophisticated in our choices for what to eat, or the plethora of great restaurants to get fresh, quality food in CLE has skyrocketed. It's the 2nd part of the equation here.\n\nCan't say it's a typical diner, greasy food experience as any restaurant can serve greasy food if cooked unproperly. With George's, everything we ordered tasted like frozen cooked to order, nothing was fresh. Even their home fries tasted like what you can buy in a grocery store. Why wouldn't a restaurant make their own homefries? Sausage gravy - watery, nasty. Greek omelet the feta tasted like pellets, not real feta. Their \"homemade soups, news for you - many restaurants soups are comprised of leftovers they're trying to use up. George's is no exception both with their \"homemade\" chicken noodle and chicken orzo. Both were heaping glops of a mess. There's a reason that soup, salad, 2 sides come with entres. Wow, what a deal right? No. Their dinner salad consisted of semi-brown iceberg lettuce, 1 cherry tomato and 2 slivers of cucumber that looked like they were halfway to becoming pickles :( !!.\nThere comes a time when diners will stop compromising food quality for supposed \"value\" and \"big portions\".

I think the \"thing\" about the dutch crunch is that the cheese is baked into the crust? Honestly, I do not care what the \"thing\" is, it is unlike any other sandwich bread.\n\n I had the Menage a Trois and my hubby had the Bear Hug. Both were delicious. \n\nThe mozzarella sticks are not worth the $4 or $5 they are charging. \n\nYou may want to research the menu online before going in the first time so you are not completely overwhelmed.",

We had the pizza and the meatballs and spaghetti. We split both dishes and we both felt sick about three quarters of the way through. Same symptoms, same time, same food. No coincidences here. We had not eaten since early morning and felt fine all day. \n\nWe have eaten here before and enjoyed it, (see prior review) and aside from our gastric discomfort, we were more disappointed to have been let down by the kitchen. Recommend a review of ingredients to check for expired or rancid food, a deep cleaning of the kitchen, storage areas and dining area, a check on refrigeration and warming area temperatures, refresh the condiments with new containers, review dishwashing and other sanitary procedures with the staff. We love supporting great vegan restaurants so it hurts us to say we can no longer recommend this one.",

If you are even a few minutes late, they will give your table to people that are waiting and tell you to go to their marketplace. Yup, that happened to us.\n\nWe waited for a few members of our group before walking in together and waited in a line for the hostess. Parking is not the greatest so some of us had to walk a bit from our cars. We were about 5 minutes late when we got in line and by the time we got to the hostess, it was 9 minutes past our reservation time. She seemed a bit flustered and by the time she decided to tell us she gave up our table, it was 10 minutes past. Most restaurants would hold your table for 10-15 minutes. She told us we could get food from their marketplace but we actually wanted to enjoy a nice sit-down meal. I mean... that's why we had a reservation. She decides she can seat us after looking at the restaurant. I thought it was especially odd because they had a bunch of empty tables indoors and outside the entire time we were there.\n\nAnyway, we get sat and never had anyone greet us at the table for 10+ minutes. I stopped a server to ask if we had a server and they said yes and our server walked past to let us know he would be over soon. The hostess sees our table (after 15 minutes) without any waters so she grabs us some. We were a bit distracted because we were catching up but I definitely noticed the timing. \n\n3 of us order mimosas and it took a bit longer because they ran out of fruit and flutes. We end up with wine glasses, which was totally fine. \n\nWe decided to start with the bread pudding and it was actually pretty yummy! I believe it was made with croissants. We also ordered a chocolate croissant to share and I wished it was flakier and less chewier.\n\nFor my entree, I went with the wild mushroom, goat cheese & leek tart. I saw it on Yelp prior to our brunch so I had been eyeing it up all morning. It showed up overcooked but I ate it (See photo). I was starving. It came with some breakfast potatoes and fruit. I wouldn't order it again based off my experience.\n\nThe others enjoyed their meals. One of us got the Egg Strata Cobbler and I enjoyed a bite of it so if I decide to give this place a try again, I would get that. Another went with the Breakfast Quesadilla and she liked it. The birthday girl got the Wild Mushroom and Chive Omelet.  \n\nOur server was actually really nice but we could tell he was a bit flustered. He brought the birthday girl a cute cupcake with a candle and extra utensils to share but we were all so stuffed. This place is a big 'maybe' on my list to be revisited because I had heard so many good things before my visit.",

It's a toss up between here and the buffet at South Point. Circus Circus might win out for the worst buffet because their employees weren't very friendly and did a terrible job of cleaning plates off tables.\n\nFirst of all, let me address the food. I've been spoiled by going to the buffets at Bellagio, Wynn, and M Resort where the selections are endless and quality is top notch. But, here... dios mio... it's abysmal. They have four different stations: breakfast, lunch, salad, dessert.\n\nBreakfast\n- waffles: soggy\n- pancakes: dry and hard\n- bacon: burnt \n- cheese blintzes: ok\n- sausage: you can get better quality in the frozen food section of any grocery store\n\nLunch\n- mashed potatoes: good\n- taquitos: dry, hard to swallow\n- fried shrimp: decent\n- pizza: reminded me of cafeteria food at my high school\n- chicken fingers: limp, the breading was a little soggy\n- penne pasta: average\n- green beans and mixed veggies: average\n- They also had burgers and fried chicken which i didn't try\n\nSalad Bar\n- pasta salad: decent\n\nDesserts\n- cookies: the best this buffet has to offer.\n- brownie: dry and crumbly.\n- carrot cake: dry and crumbly.\n- raspberry cheesecake: mushy but decent\n\nThere just wasn't much to choose from in this buffet and the stuff they did have was poor quality. We tried most of what they had, but nothing was above average. When your best items are mashed potatoes and cookies you know you're in trouble. The service was just plain bad. We had a pile of dishes sitting on the edge of our table that wasn't picked up until we were ready to leave. Thank god we got free passes to this place because I would be pissed if I actually had to spend money to eat here.",

        "text": "So this place gets a zero for me but Yelp doesn't have that option! It's located inside the Palms hotel and I come here every Monday with my family for movie night. I've been seeing the billboards on the side of the road and the ads for the Turkey Dinner burger in the elevators and my mouth was watering wanting to try it. My boyfriend is never in the mood for burgers when we visit Palms but this Labor Day I finally harassed him enough and he said yes we'll go here for dinner. So after the movies we trecked our way through the long hallways to Cafe 6 to try this burger they so avidly have been advertising. It opens at 5pm so we got there a few minutes after 5pm and first impression was beautiful but empty. The decor is setup like a small restaurant with a lounge feel with a view of the spa pool and brick columns with digital fireplaces on display. There is a bar with three LCD TV screens showing three different sports games and one bartender. The lady who greeted us was also our Waitress and she did not mention this so at first I wasn't sure we should order with her but after bringing our drinks she starting taking food orders so I guess. \n\nNow on to the food, we ordered buffalo hot wings and the \"Turkey Dinner\" burger with skinny fries. I had a Sauvignon Blanc and my boy had a beer. My Sauvignon Blanc came out first and it was extremely sour aka cheap even for a house wine. I imagine this is what those dollar store wines taste like! So I stuck to the water. The buffalo wings came out after and I had a few they were regular as I expected but I'm not a fan of hot wings so this was mainly my bf's dish. After eating a couple he pulled out a wing and showed me a wing with a huge patch of fried chicken hair. Gross! Don't you fully clean the chicken before cooking? Then my Turkey Dinner arrived and it looked nothing like the posters. I know that photographers photo shop but kudos to the photog because this burger looked completely different! The \"meat\" was gray and so was the bun. I bit into it and stopped mid-bite. What I had just tasted my brain couldn't comprehend. The taste or lack there of was horrendous! Dry, flavorless and yuck, just Yuck! I have never tasted something that bad ever! That was not turkey meat and I eat tofu and veggie burgers and they still have never tasted like that so I don't know what kind of mystery meat that was! I still can't barely explain just how bad it was. Tasted like how I imagine diabetic hospital food would taste! No seasoning, bland, not fresh and just not good! I quickly grabbed the sour white wine to swallow my bite. I thought maybe it's just the initial bite so I cleansed my pallet with the glass of water and fries and tried again. I took two more bites but on my last third bite I decided not to submit my tastebuds to such torture and gave up. I downed the glass of sour wine to get the taste of my tongue and asked for the check. \n\nAnother reason why I gave up was because on my last bite I noticed some gray fatty matter from the burger. I lifted up the bun to find even more gray fatty matter coming from the burger! Ewe how could you put that in with the burger doesn't the Chef inspect the food after he cooks it and sends it out? I so wanted to like this place and this burger but I declare that the person in the kitchen must be a line cook and not a real Chef because no self-respecting Chef that loves food and loves what he/she does would send out something that grotesque! Now I know why this place was so empty. You have a beautiful space and amazing advertisements but I suggest instead of spending thousands of dollars on those giant billboards you spend your money and figure out what's going on going on inside that kitchen because if that is how bad your promotional dish tastes I shudder to think how the rest of the food on the menu tastes! The only thing that was good i.e. safe was the water and skinny fries.\n\nBig let down for me and I'm sorry to say I cannot bring myself to recommend this to not even my worst enemy.",

Specially when the cup is against his armpit. Secondly I shouldnt  have to ask for ginger and wasabi at my table and if I do at least bring it. Last nights visit I asked 2 different servers and nothing. And finally down to the food, oh boy last night was the worst ever. The tempura crumbs on my sushi was stale and tasted old. I cant be the only one thought it. And certainly hope I'm not the only to mention it in the reviews. Most of of the rolls were dry and just didnt have some of the ingredients that it has in the past, not sure if it was a new cook or something but my last 2 visits have been a horrible experience. Service sucks and now the food is tasting to take a hit. I will be back one last time in hope that they change it up, if not I will sadly end this 4 to 5 years relationship. At the end of the day theres a sushi spot in just about every other corner and one of the reasons I came here was for their service and distance from home. But if the food sucks and service sucks I will gladly make the drive to other places.",

I can see why as the menu feels South by Southwest if you know what I mean. It has a definite twang but it ain't lard-laden heart attack on a plate like a deep-fried Paula Deen extravaganza. A group of us arrived at the Shops at Town & Country where I immediately let out a foodie sigh since Chris Bianco's famous Pizzeria Bianco was right next door. Been wanting to try that. So close yet so far away. Anyway, six of us huddled into one of the party booths competing with a much louder group.\n\nFor some reason, a $9 White Chocolate Martini sounded good and pretty cheap with 360 vanilla vodka, Bailey's and Godiva white chocolate liqueur (photo: http://bit.ly/2foPpfJ). Just a bit too sweet but on a humid Arizona evening, not a bad libation to sip. We shared a couple of appetizers that managed to satisfy our collective palates. The first was the $9 Piggly Wiggly, a generous platter of mini-baby back ribs, pork belly, and prosciutto-wrapped asparagus (photo: http://bit.ly/2exAlgN). It was certainly meaty enough and most essentially, quite shareable. The second was better, the refreshing $8 Common Ground Burrata, which presented fresh mozzarella, dressed arugula, spicy tomato jam, and happily, six toast points, one for each of us (photo: http://bit.ly/2flx9mV).\n\nThe freshness of the mozzarella really brought this one home. For my entree, I went for a house favorite, the $18 Spit Fire Chicken, which took a half-roasted chicken (a bit too charred) and laid it on top of a huge slice of bread soaked in pan drippings and accessorized it with New Orleans-style \"dirty\" orzo mixed in a cup of gumbo (photo: http://bit.ly/2fEBAxj). I thought the bread was going to be carb overkill but it was so saturated with the poultry juices that it became almost polenta-like. The chicken could have been a bit more tender, but hey,I didn't complain since I was filling out the expense report. A good time was had by all, and now I know where at least one of the Pizzeria Biancos is.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...Southern dishes with a modern sensibility and good flavors that don't reek of lard\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...contemporary take on a Southern cafe, I think\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...certainly attentive enough\nTOTAL - 4 stars...definitely would come back even as a paying customer",

After some calling around I was pleased to find out that prince of India delivered to the hospital.\n\nWe needed the food delivered as close to 5p as possible as we didn't want to interrupt the meeting by having it come later.  So at 240p (since they are closed 3-430). I called to see if I could place the order to give them plenty of time to make, etc.  They thanked us for doing this. \n\n5pm comes and almost on the dot the delivery driver calls to say he's in the lobby.  Fantastic!  I get the food - (and left a hefty tip!) and take it up to to the docs. 5 of them got chicken tikka masala - all different spice levels.  NOT A SINGLE CONTAINER WAS MARKED.   Really?!?  Note to prince of India staff:  this would be incredibly helpful.  So the person who got a level 1 may have been stuck with a 5.  Not cool prince of India.  Really - not cool.  \n\nNot a single container out of everything - vegetarian dishes, meat dishes, etc were marked. So it was a guessing game.\n\nThe naan (enough for 12) was essentially crumbled into a ball - no one could get a full piece of naan.  \n\nOh - to make matters better we paid for raita - but I am currently sitting in the lobby (530p) waiting for it to be brought because they didn't bring it - or the driver left it in the car.  I was told 10 minutes - when I called them at 505p.  We asked for a credit - because everyone is done eating.  They refused. So we have wasted food and money.  It was finally delivered at 5:40p.\n\nWe have another meeting like this in January and were planning Indian food.  But I don't imagine it will be with prince of India again.  What a disappointment.  Definitely avoid take out.",

        "text": "Alright. . . ticking off the list:\n\n1)  Nice atmosphere\n2)  Good service\n3)  meh food\n\nIt's new, and pretty, and while it's a \"diner\", it's a diner that was built in the last three months, so the decor is pretty sweet, everything is all clean and gleaming brushed stainless and muted colors.  No patina of cigarette smoke and coffee stains, like the tried and true diners of old.  Which is a good thing.\n\nThe service was good, I don't recall her being particularly knowledgeable, but how knowledgeable could she have been since we ate there two weeks after they opened?  I also don't remember her being NOT knowledgeable.  So. . . YAY!\n\nNow for the bad. . . \n\nI ordered a reuben.  My friend remarked that it's hard to find a place that has a good reuben.  I didn't necessarily agree, but said nothing.  We both got it.  We were both surprised to see it served open face, which, upon asking the manager (we'll come back to him in a minute) was because, \"It's the chef's interpretation of a reuben.  He wanted to make it unique.\"  \n\nIt WAS unique.  But unique in a way that sucked.  Like if the chef interpreted a hot dog by saying, \"HERE we serve our hot dogs with the mustard in your hand instead of on the dog. \"  It was a stupid interpretation.  Messy.  And not good.  Because the sauerkraut was kind of slippery, and the cheese was kind of melty, and the dressing was very heavy handed, so when you used your knife to cut it you ended up with half the sandwich still on the plate because it wouldn't stick on the fork, so you had a bite of cheese and dressing, then went back for a bite of bread and saurkraut and meat.  It was sloppy and I ended up scooping most of the dressing onto the side of the plate so it was tolerable.  And on the plus side there was a lot of food. . . but the negative of that was it was really hard to cut without food dropping off the side of the plate while you sawed at the sandwich through the meat.  \n\nSo then the manager came to our table, which I generally liked, but he was so aggressively wanting to nip any issues in the bud that he came across a little. . . militantly servile.  \"Did everything exceed your expectations?\" he asked.  Then when our grunts of polite assent didn't suffice, he addressed each of us individually. . . it was uncomfortable.  I just wanted to be left to eat my shitty sandwich in peace.  I felt uncomfortable complaining about my shitty sandwich, because it was, of course, ON PURPOSE.  Did it exceed my expectations?  No!  But I didn't really want to interrupt my meal to have a discussion about it.  I bought his departure by saying that I didn't really have any expectations coming in, so I couldn't really judge whether they'd been exceeded.  Which was a lie.\n\nWhen we paid our bill. . . the manager was at the cash register. . . eagerly waiting to ask, once more, \"Did your experience exceed your expectations?\"  UGGGGHHHH!  I just wanted to leave.  \"I don't know, yes. . . yes, it was fine!\"  \n\nUltimately, I will return.  It was really close to work, and it's my own fault for not reading that they serve the reuben open faced.  I assume it's on the menu that way.  And next time I'll just tell the manager to go away because he's bothering me, which is more my speed. . . I was just caught a little off guard.\n\nIf my next experience is. . . better (which will exceed my expectations) I'll update my review and add a star or two to it.  Until then though. . . it was \"meh\".  Diner food.",

Called in my order at 8PM, was told to be there in ten minutes- arrived in 15, and still waited another 10. Not a big deal, gave me time to take in the d\u00e9cor.\n\nI'm not sure why whoever opened this restaurant to sell Peruvian food and didn't bother to remodel he interior. Even just painting the red portions of the walls and trim to yellow or green, to match the logo on their business cards, would be a huge step up and be more cohesive and on theme.\n\nFinally got my food and headed home, hoping the lack of Peruvian influence in the d\u00e9cor was not going to be repeated in the kitchen. But I was at least partially surprised by the quality of the food: the lomo saltado was a plentiful portion (thankfully, as the pricetag was $14) with peppers, onions, and steak strips over an overwhelming portion of fries, served alongside white rice. The rice actually, was very good. Despite not appearing to have any seasoning, it was flavorful and moist without being \"wet\". Loved using it to soak up the extra juices from the steak and onion saut\u00e9. However, I do agree with other reviews that say that the steak could have been more tender.\nThe stuffed avocado was perhaps the most underwhelming Peruvian dish I've ever paid $7 for. The avocado was not even ripe, and the mashed potato, chicken, and mayo mixture was bland and homogenous to the point where I could not find chicken in the dish. Not sure how or why this is so highly recommended in other reviews, maybe it was just an off day.\n\nSide note: the creamy-looking red salsa sauce they have is surprisingly flavorful.. and has quite a bit of kick to it! Definitely get it but use it sparingly until you figure out if you can take the heat.\n\nEdited to add; subtracting an additional star because I got sick to my stomach shortly after posting this (about 10 minutes after finishing my meal) and I continue to feel queasy.",

        "text": "Something has gone off the rails at Fox Smokehouse BBQ, which is normally one of the places I can count on for great food and good service. I visited on Saturday Sept 17th and I've posted 2 pictures for review. The first is a part of Combo #4 - Brisket and Ribs, a side of Mac & Cheese and Pit Beans, and cornbread. Normally this is what I call failsafe food. It's always been done right at Fox, at least until this visit. I understand that it's impossible to trim all the fat away from every cut of meat. But the brisket this time had 2x as much fat as normal, and the ribs...while they did fall off the bone like they always do, I found so much fat when I bit into them that it triggered an automatic gag reflex. Just couldn't do it. \n\nAnd then there's the Mac & Cheese. I have a 6 year old who has ate the Mac & Cheese at Fox many, many times. But not this time. The stuff they brought out to our table got one bite from the 3 of us before we all said NO, and pushed it away. We've ordered this at least 20 times for both eat in and carry out. And it's never, ever looked like what we were served. \n\nOn top of that our server didn't seem to be attentive despite the fact the place was not busy. We ordered rootbeer for my 6 year old as part of a kids menu order. We got a full sized cup instead of the smaller kids size. That's nice if you're sharing or you don't mind giving him a sugar buzz but we wanted the kids size to keep him from being wound up on extra sugar, and that's why we ordered what we did. And my wife specifically asked for no water to be brought to the table as our son has a tendency to spill it. We made that request twice, and yet it was brought out anyway. \n\nMy point here is that at least on this visit, the quality of the food and the service that we've experienced time after time after time substantially slipped. I know this is a small but growing business, and the owners are working hard to fix any issues that come up. And for the most part any issue that's come up they've fixed it, and raised the bar high for some of the best BBQ west of the Rockies. But it's been years since I left BBQ on the plate and walked out and that's what happened on Saturday. I don't know what was going on Saturday morning but I want the true Fox BBQ experience back. What my family and I experienced on Saturday is an anomaly, and one that I hope to not experience again.",

I think the garlic sauce is what makes it a home run for me.  \n\nI've also ordered the Bulgoki Bowl $7.99.

The sushi menu looked impressive but once we tried it out we were left underwhelmed.  All of their rolls were fairly small too.  I would say quality overall is on par with Watami's sushi.  And when you're a regular restaurant competing with a buffet, quality is the one edge you want to have over the competition.\n\nAlso tried the katsudon here and was left unsatisfied.  It was basically a deep fried pork cutlet over plain rice.  No sticky rice.  No extra veggies or egg. Even the pork was pretty bland. Try Asian Garden in Parma to see how it's done right.\n\nService is acceptable. Atmosphere is quiet and intimate. Was empty when I went, which was dinner time on a weekday. \n\nYes it's a Japanese restaurant in Parma so you can't expect much, but there are other Japanese restaurants in Parma that do it better. I won't write this place off completely. There maybe an undiscovered gem on the menu that will tickle my tastebuds. Unfortunately I will be eating the discovered gems at other restaurants.

I was pleasantly and deliciously surprised. The cookie dough is also eggless, so another plus.\n\n*1, 2, or 3 Scoops* My friend ordered three scoops of the regular chocolate chip edible cookie dough so she could save it to eat for dessert for more than one night.\n\n*Ice Cream & Cookie Dough* -I ordered half vanilla bean ice cream and half s'mores cookie dough. The s'mores cookie dough consisted of cookie dough base with chocolate chunks, graham cracker crumbs, and tiny marshmallows- super yum yum. The vanilla ice cream tastes a lot like a vanilla custard that I remember my mom used to make for dessert at parties back in the day..it was a unique and different taste for an ice cream that I brought me back to a flavor from my childhood! I would probably go back and just get the ice cream if I could.\n\n--Other Options--\n\n*Gluten Free & Vegan Cookie Dough* - glancing at the menu, I noticed they also serve gluten free peanut butter or oatmeal cinnamon cookie dough as well as vegan chocolate chip cookie dough for those of you who fall under either/both of those classifications!\n\n*Baked Cookies--- not a fan of unbaked? you can still get baked cookies. I have yet to try these, but based off of how delicious the edible cookie dough was, I'm sure the baked cookies are just as tasty\n\n*Ice Cream Sandwiches- sandwich ice cream of choice in between baked or unbaked cookies\n\n*Cookie Dough/Ice cream in a Cone---you can also eat your cookie dough in a waffle cone if you want...cute, fresh, delicious, and not to mention Insta-worthy option\n\n\nI highly recommend this cookie dough for any cookie/cookie dough/ice cream/dessert lover!",

Whatever that shit you get when things are not sealed and get germs in.\n\nTwice I have tried and I'll pass on going back.\n\nI want to support local business but not when the product is out of stock, they \"close up\" hours early, they are awkward at the register, awkward all around......\n\nMeh.",

Outside was pretty full but inside only 4 tables had people at them including our own table.\nSeated immediately no offer to grab a high chair just got them pointed out to us.\n\nThe woman bartending was also our waitress so we rarely got helped. She practically RAN and didn't even take our complete order she was in such a hurry going back and forth from job to job. We told her we wanted to add a kids teriyaki and a teriyaki rice to the order she had ran away from taking without asking if she had everything before leaving the table. Those items never came. She comped the kids meal and brought it in a to-go bag LONG after we were done eating, but the second rice bowl wasn't in there or spoken of again. No one wears name tags or introduces themselves so I never got a name. \n\nIt seems they don't have staff doing one job which definitely hurts their business- a bartender needs to focus on the people at the bar. A server needs to be polite and friendly, not rushing through the customer service part of their job. No idea who the floor manager was or if there was one. Wasn't offered a bar menu. The cooks were randomly serving food as well. It was a hot mess from a management standpoint. Everyone but the 2 sushi chefs were basically running around like a chicken with its head cut off at all times. I will say they refilled drinks often which was nice. Food took forever to come to the table, miso and edamame should've been out a lot faster.\n\nIf the service changes it would greatly benefit the business. You can't lack connection with customers in a customer based industry and unfortunately this place does.",

I am a big fan of the blush peach tea as it taste sweet but not over the top. I don't have a big sweet-tooth and the blush tea being pretty moderate is like a match made in heaven for me.\n\nThe cotton candy slushii/shaved snow is really cool.

They were not well cooked and lacked the spicy Thai chili that I was expecting.  Needless to say, I was doubly disappointed.  To top that off, service was not up to par, especially since the restaurant was pretty empty before the after work crowd arrived.  I will say, however, the men in the bar seemed content with their beer, food, and service.  Their satisfaction was likely pre-empted by the Hooters-like, scantily-clad wait staff.

Coming from the South this is typical for green beans. The minestrone soup was regular institutional soup that probably came in a frozen brick. I liked it. My wife had the meat loaf which was very good. Being \"seniors\" and not being terribly hungry we had the smaller portions and it was perfect for us.

But my main work squeeze and I were working late and decided that happy hour was the place for us. We have went to a few other places before and we have not been that thrilled by our choices. Today we thought, was the day for good food and drinks. \n\nI made a reservation on Open Table, when we go there it was dead and honestly they didn't even look up my reservation (I know this because I never got the confirmation email that Open Table usually sends). \n\nTIP: Happy Hour specials and prices are ONLY, ONLY, ONLY  in the bar area. I would think that this wouldn't really be the case BUT IT IS so thank God we asked. I was all about the happy hour and not about full price. \n\nThe happy hour menu was pretty reasonable but the problem (I saw this in other reviews) is that the menu was nice BUT there were more \"off menu\" specials that you had to ask for. I don't know about you but I want all the specials in one place and not have to ask about them. This also was true with the drink specials. I asked, \"what is the happy hour special today?\" Instead of just saying $2 off mixed drinks our waiter told us two of the drinks and we just decided on that. (This part of the review just made me take back a star....)\n\nThe drinks were great. Like GREAT, GREAT. I loved the gin drink that I had. I looked on the menu to try to see if what I had was on it but I do not see anything that has gin, sorry I can't suggest to try it by name. Just ask for the grapefruit and gin mixed drink. Hopefully it will be the same one and you will love it too. \n\nSo the flatbread was half off. (Learned only after we heard someone talk about and asked.) \n\nWe ordered the: \nPepper and Onion flatbread\nCharred Tomato Sauce, Provolone,\nFried Brussels Sprout Leaves\n\nThe fried brussel sprouts were amazing. I wish they put more of them on the pizza because this is what made it really enjoyable to me. Other than that it was a plain peppers and onion pizza. No pizzazz nothing but regular pizza. But I will say it was really big. LIKE BIG for two of us 6 slices big. I was impressed by the size. For it being a flatbread appetizer I was really expecting a smaller plate and serving size. It was substantial. \n\nThen we ordered the:\nBlackened Fish Tacos\nGreen Tomato Relish,\nCrawfish Boil Aioli\n\nThis was good. I could have probably ordered two of these plates and been happy. It was a good slice of fish inside of a quarter of a pita. The slaw/relish was really good. It had a bit of a kick to it (or maybe that was the blackened seasoning). The fish was also topped with a spicy mayo type of dressing. I love fish tacos and these really hit the spot. I was impressed and would order them again. \n\nWe were still hungry so then we ordered the:\nChicken Kebobs\nHoney Cajun sauce (I am guessing I can not find where they are listed in the menu)\n\nThis plate came with two kebobs and they were so juicy. I sometimes are a bit apprehensive of kebobs because they can either be super burnt, super dry, or both. These were really well done. The only complaint is that I wish the sauce they came drizzled in was in a bowl that I could take home and use every day. But seriously I really liked the sauce and the taste of the kebobs. Get them. \n\nThen.....dessert:\nWe ordered the beignets. I will say while they are good because really it is fried dough with sugar, I was not impressed. The beignets were COVERED in powdered sugar.  Totally drenched. So that means that the sugar kind of congealed and made the beignets a bit gross to look at and eat. Usually when I have had beignets they just had a sprinkling of powdered sugar, NOLA went a bit over the top with the sugar. That is my complaint. The sorbet that we picked (wild berry) was so good that I can overlook the weirdness of the dessert. \n\nGo to NOLA have a good time and enjoy the food. It is a good place to go out downtown.",

        "text": "Let me preface this: I don't recommend visiting any  Yardhouse when it isn't happy hour. The entrees aren't worth it, and the beers are $8+ per pint. \n\nThat being said, Yardhouse used to have a world-class happy hour. It was consistent in every location I've visited across the country, from Hawaii to New York. Great apps that were half price, and a phone-book's worth of beers to choose from that were also half off. Lady friends will also dig the half off martinis and cocktails. Solid.\n\nHowever, as of late, the institution that is their happy hour has faltered. Ahi sashimi has gone from a generous fanned out steak to a pathetic strip diced into 6 pieces, maybe 1/3 of what you used to get. Same can be said for the downsizing of pizzas, nachos, calamari. Yes, you probably used to get more than what you paid for (which I made up for in doubling down on the still overpriced pints), but now, I feel like I'm being cheated by their bean counters. I wonder if they're weighing out happy hour portions to the gram in kitchen before the dish is plated...\n\nThe menu has changed, and is much easier to peruse. A few new apps, cocktails and dishes here and there. Still, after trying a few of their entrees over the years, I find that nothing really blows my skirt up here. Not really a great choice for dinner, since they try to do a bit of everything (American, Asian, Italian, etc.), and don't do anything exceptionally well. But, they also seem to be rotating more beers into the mix more regularly, as updated on the flat screens around the bar, which I appreciate.\n\nAll in all, a good place for a good happy hour. Not what it used to be (food wise), but still in the 97th percentile in my opinion.",

The anticipation to the table makes it even more interesting, shiny silver carts pass the room complete with buckets of champagne and wine, some holding chocolate desserts that tower over, it almost seems like a scene from the Great Gatsby! I have had the opportunity to visit almost every Mr. Chows with my favorite location being the Miami Location. I never seem to order anything different and this time around, same old thing. Satay Chicken, and yes it's kind of orangeish looking red with a white dipping sauce, it looks gross but it is absolutely perfection!!  The taste is flavorful, yet powerful enough to eat either with the sauce or without, the second item I always always get is the walnut shrimp, perfect size to share with another guest, just the right amount of shrimp and the right amount of walnuts, I enjoy it over or with Mr. Chows lobster fried rice. Some might say Mr. Chows is overpriced for Chinese food and I would absolutely agree, it's very costly! The quality is wayyyy above panda express and any other take out I would give Mr. Chows a try, remember it's for the experience .",

Sound the alarm, the apocalypse is coming, because this is quite an amazing feat.\n\nThis place just opened so the service is excellent with them constantly checking up on you and making sure everything is up to par. We'll see if they keep this up a few months down the road though as things tend to slip, just like when you're out of your honeymoon phase in a relationship and you finally feel comfortable farting in each other's presence. They've definitely invested into this place's decor and I could see this being a place just to catch up and drink, even for those who squeal like a frightened pig at the idea of seafood. I loved the patio area - definitely doesn't make you feel like you just parked in some monotonous Chandler shopping plaza. \n\nFood was excellent and everything came out on time. They make sure you understand from the get go that they use sustainable seafood which I can appreciate, though I'm weary about such claims. I'm so glad I ordered what I did. I normally don't order it because Shrimp Scampi dishes tend to usually only come with enough shrimp sized to feed a goldfish, but the portions were perfect and hearty to my surprise. No longer am I afraid to order any shrimp dishes at this establishment, in fear that it'll only disappoint me. Kind of like when I get the mail hoping I'll get something other than bills. \n\nI do wish that they put some complimentary bread or snack while you're waiting. Besides the menu, they have specials everyday so be on the lookout for that on the chalkboard. I came with a party of 5 and everyone's food looking pretty amazing presentation-wise. The soup comes filled to the brim so if you were expecting to have to order a side salad, you might want to think twice as that baby could fill you up by itself. The only thing I wouldn't recommend is any of the nigiri because I don't think you're getting your money's worth for what they serve. They aren't an Angry Crab kind of a restaurant, more of a fish and general American food restaurant so don't come expecting any other sea creatures. \n\nThey have my favorite type of seating: booths - but just a limited amount so if you're hoping for one, just make a reservation with that request. Red Lobster across the street finally has some competition after a couple of failed attempts in this very same space. This restaurant was meant for Gilbert or Scotty, but somehow ended up in boring Chandler which I am so grateful for.",

The manager seated us and he was very friendly and had some suggestions regarding their beer samplers.  Our server Marc was absolutely the bomb. He was one of the best waiters I have ever come across.  Extremely attentive, very engaging, and very focused on the guests.  When he talked to you, you felt like the most important person in the room.  My best buddy from Sweden was with us and he can be very demanding, but Marc handled him perfectly and made some great recommendations when it came to the different beer samplers.  We did a testing where we rated the beers and Marc seemed genuinely interested and checked back with us for the final results.  Before we left we asked another waiter to get the manager (the same guy that had seated us) and we took on a stern attitude as he approached the table and he later admitted that he was getting ready to be complained to, as that's usually the case when he gets called.  We however, only had positive things for him.",

My daughter was tasked with finding our lunch stop and this was the find of the month. Though they've been in Vegas for years it has also been many years since I've been to one, and after this visit I'm still trying to figure out why it's been so long. As usual I complained about the drive and once again it was more than worth it. We were greeted by smiling friendly staff that actually had my kids laughing. That in itself is worth any drive. Apparently my son and I are gross because we like onions on our sandwich lol. The peppers I added must be a travesty. (These were the jokes between my daughter and the cashier) All three of us ordered the Philly and a side of the bacon cheese fries. Mine with peppers and onions, Jeremy's with onions, and Brittney's plain. They were perfection. Served piping hot right off the grill and packed full of deliciousness. These sandwiches were so good I'm wiping drool off my phone screen as I type this. Don't forget hot. I was a little too ambitious and took a huge bite of my sandwich as soon as it was served to me. A mistake I will never make again lol. There is nothing better when eating out than having your food served directly from the source of its creation to you, rather than sitting under artificial heat. The cheese fries are a whole other story. They almost need their own review they're so good. Unlike most places that serve cheese fries these were layered. Not just a pile of fries with cheese sauce poured over the top, but cheese on every fry. My son was the first to point this out and it became a challenge to find a fry without any cheese on it ...I did not. I finished my sandwich and my fries and found myself trying to stuff the remainder of Jeremy's sandwich down my throat. That's just how delicious these sandwiches were. I almost succeeded by the way. Brittney did not. Her second half went home where it was devoured hours later secretly away from onlookers who may try and steal a bite.I believe there are at least 2 locations but I will always visit this one in Henderson. When you find magic you always return to the same show. From great food to great staff, Straight From Philly is absolute magic.\nWatch the video!\nhttps://youtu.be/sb-tzLYDdeA",

The restaurant is tastefully decorated and the service, while a little slow at times, is still pretty good. I liked that our server explained what each dish was and how to eat it; I'm new to Cambodian food so his explanations were really helpful.\n\nWe had a beef noodle dish, which was really tasty. I like the texture of the noodles and the beef had a wonderful flavor. We also had a beef dish with a sour, crunchy sauce, raw vegetables, and rice. The beef was good, and the sauce was very interesting. Our last dish was fish - really great flavor. Again, I didn't see the menu so I can't list the names of the dishes - sorry! :(\n\nI did feel the portions were a little small for the price, but I do realize that the ingredients are probably expensive to purchase in Phoenix, so I can understand the justification for the price. It wasn't outrageously expensive, so I was fine with the final cost of our meal. Overall, very nice food and very cute restaurant.\n\nI would have given this restaurant 4 stars but I decided to only give 3. I love Yelp, and I depend on reviews, good and bad, to help guide my decisions. I do agree that the customer is not always right, but I think the high and low ratings for this restaurant are fair because everyone has a different experience, palate, expectations, etc. I'm fine with the owner defending the restaurant against poor reviews, but many of his replies mock the customer, contain rude language, and just leave a bad impression. I think both owners and customers have a duty to treat one another with respect, which I don't see here.\n\nI am all for supporting local businesses, and I would love to come back, but I'm honestly not sure I will.

In the 1970s, the Barrow family bought this structure, and turned it into the \"Spaghetti Company,\" and was in business until the mid 1990s, when it was sold to the current owners of the Italian restaurant chain, The Old Spaghetti Factory.

In the winter the snowbirds will be back but for now this is a great deal and place.  It is on our top 5 places to eat! I give it a thumbs up!!!",

Having said that, Ethel M Chocolate tastes pretty good.\n\nWe took the free walk-through tour and it was pretty neat. There are more-detailed tours/presentation you can take but I believe they are in the $75.00 range. A Chocolate presentation? Really? Anyway, after the tour, you can check out and purchase chocolates and souvenirs in their large gift shop. They will also ship items. \n\nThere is a cool cactus garden just outside the shop, if you are into that sort of thing.",

Due to a recent surgery, I am only able to eat small amounts. I figured Zupa's would be a great place to go because the soup would be good on my stomach. I have a special card from my doctor asking that I be allowed to order from the kids menu (since most places have an age limit). I asked for a kids meal and they said that I could order one but that it would cost me more because I'm an adult. What?! I didn't get extra food. The portions weren't bigger. It was the exact same as a regular kids meal but I had to pay 3 dollars more! It's totally stupid because I couldn't even eat the entire meal. As much as I like their food, I doubt I will go back because I don't think I should pay extra money for a kids meal just because I am an adult. Dumb.",

Which is typically a good sign, but it looked borderline at capacity. Moving on, we opted to sit on the patio and it was a great choice! They had misters that added a great touch and I enjoyed people watching! Only tip would be if you don't like pets don't come out here. It's a pet friendly area and in addition to a few dogs Mother Nature's pets attended... there was a fair amount of pigeons. Almost unsanitary because they'd get really close and flap off leaving all sorts of pigeon germs in the air. The restaurant can consider enclosing the area with that garden wood or something that would keep it a bit more sanitary. \n\nMoving on to the food. I felt first off there's way too much going on with the menu. Pictures, eggs , burritos, omelettes, chili, pancakes, and everything is served a thousand ways! I was overwhelmed. Thankfully my baby just learned to read and knew he wanted waffles! I on the other hand ordered half a bacon and avocado omelette and a side of corned beef hash! \n\nAt best, the food was ok. The omelette was well cooked but the amount of avocado was overwhelming, a shock because usually you don't receive enough. The bacon was non existent because of the overwhelming avocado. The hash was mushy. I'd read it in another review and thought impossible, but the flavor was good, but the texture was similar to that of fried stringy mashed potatoes.  I will brag my baby's waffle was delicious, fluffy, and crispy! I'd come back for the waffles and the bacon!",

What more could you need?\n\nArepas are hot pockets of goodness, unless of course you go with the cold ingredients. They are a bit like a cornbread sandwich, as it is a corn dough. I have sampled the black bean and chicken, and I will say that I prefer the chicken. I have not perfected the right amount to order, as they make you really full quickly, but then shortly after you may find yourself snacky again, so my advice: overeat. I think that if you can you should do your best to eat at least 3. Or, just be content with a little snack and have one.\n\nThey are served up fresh and hot, and this is a food stand, so expect to sit outside and eat. The service is incredibly friendly and on top of customer service. Special orders do not upset them, and they actually gave my pal an extra empanada because one cracked!\n\nI am a fan of their mango juice. It isn't too sweet and is the perfect refreshing treat to balance the heat of being on a corner in Las Vegas eating a hot pocket. \n\nI Love Arepas should definitely be on your \"must try\" list of Vegas experiences and eats.",

I'm still in shock.\n\nThe manager came around to every table while we were there, except ours. Our servers were very rude, our food took forever to get to us and the manager completely snubbed our group.

I called the next day to speak to another manager, who was not helpful, and he said the GM I spoke to was higher up and I was welcomed to come and talk to him... OK, I live on the other side of Summerlin?!

I guess that's easier to comp but my friend didn't have much of an appetite after seeing that and I don't blame her.

That's not a great sign. I got a large plate with half rice and half salad with salmon, crab, and tuna. The food was okay- the biggest issue of all was the warm fish. It just wasn't cold enough and that really brought the taste down. \nIn addition- the service was blah. I was really excited to be there and had a few questions for the guys behind the counter. Their answers were kind of curt and annoyed. \nI'm not sure if I will return, the prices just don't justify the food.",

We waited in a long line to order, so I assumed it must be amazing. We ordered the beach house and BBQ burger, as well as fries and tater tots. It took about 30-40 minutes to get our food, but again, it was really busy, so we shrugged it off. When we saw our burgers coming they looked like they were going to be really good, so we were getting even more excited... Unfortunately, the patties were cold, yet overcooked and completely flavorless, the cheese was ice cold, it felt like it was just taken out of the fridge and because of that fell off the burger, and the bread fell apart. The tater tots tasted like the cheap frozen ones from the grocery store, but at least the fries were okay. I don't understand my experience given the reviews, but maybe I just came on a really REALLY bad day. I don't think I'd go back. I would recommend Zinburger or Hopdoddy over this place any day.",

The iced almond milk latte was just right, i dont get too creative with my drinks but I know they have an excellent selection. \n\nMy breakfast was amazing. It had spinach, carrots, very crispy potatoes which were amazing, sourdough and the perfectly blended spices on top. The eggs were poached perfect and was not dry when you finally took that first cut. \n\nThey give you a number for when they bring you your food. The seating is very communal but what I love about this concept is that gives you opportunity to meet new people or dogs since they let you bring dogs in.\n\nI met a new friend just sitting down. Break the ice and saying hello is the best way to make things less awkward. \n\nAnyway, the one thing publicus is missing are outlets. HOWEVER, if they had outlets, more people would stick around longer meaning they'd prevent others from enjoying this gem at downtown.",

I've been multiple times hoping to finally find something they do great but, alas, there isn't anything. Meats are dry and boring (trying brining those pork chops guys!) and some of the items are so poorly conceived they are disgusting. For example, the spaghetti squash was prepared with a ton of capers.  I love capers but this was so bad it rendered everything else on the plate inedible. Capers and squash- the dynamic duo. But that's what you get here; a nice decor and a miserable effort by the kitchen.",

Lotus of Siam already has high reviews and a lengthly reservation waitlist simply because their Thai food is the best in town and therefore, completely worth the wait. \n\nBest tip I can give is if you're interested in indulging in all the amazing food Lotus has to offer then decide now and book your reservation WEEKS in advance. While they have ample seating and may take a few walks in on a daily basis, your odds of getting a table are slim if you don't make a reservation in advance and you don't want to go home disappointed. \n\nNow let's talk food. They have a novel of a menu, with the price range starting at reasonable to hey there big spender. No matter what items you choose, the flavors with be authentic and impeccable. Looking for something more affordable? Stick to the apps, soups, and chicken themed dishes. Order the chicken pad thai, a classic favorite that will blow your mind and order the coconut soup, which has a spicy kick to it, but one you won't regret. Looking to spend some serious dough for a big night out???Then you must order the garlic prawns, drunken noodles, and any seafood or beef dish that your server recommends because they'll all be fantastic. One more thing, they have a massive wine list so don't be afraid to order a glass or even a bottle to accompany your meal. Your server will do a great job of checking on you often and making sure you get all the wine your little heart desires.\n\nTo the staff and chefs at Lotus, you're the bomb.

        "text": "So ... I left the range today, and as usual, on my way out of the parking lot, I called Thai Patio.  I do this nearly every Tuesday evening and every other Sunday afternoon.  The time was 5:02PM.  My call dropped due to the location of the range amongst the mountains, which sometimes happens, I could hear him, but he could not hear me.  Sadly, the call dropped after I gave my name and \"Pad Thai with chicken\" Them saying, \"Hello, hello, Chris? How spicy?  Hello?\" I never even got to the spice level, much less the second or third items I was going to order.  I tried again at 5:03 and 5:04 (5 attempts total), and it would ring, but not connect.  My phone had about 2% battery life, and by this time, I was on the road, so I skipped the Thai Patio meal.  The order was not complete, so I figured that was that.\n\nAt 7:32 they called and I did not recognize the number, so let it go, no voicemail, probably some car warranty wanker, I thought.  They called again at 7:54, so I answered and explained the above.  Then at 7:55 I got a voicemail requesting I call them or call back next time to cancel my order.  Like they were shaming me for placing an order and skipping out on them.  I called back at 7:57 to explain the issue again.  I did not finish the first item on the order so I am not sure why they would have prepared it or expected me to call back and cancel it.  The call dropped, so maybe they should have reached out to me closer to 5:10 if the order was going to put them into some sort of jeopardy.\n\nIn any event, they were very upset that they had an order of Pad Thai with chicken prepared to an unknown spice level (now nearly 3 hours old) and nobody to pay for it.  The poor kid relayed my words to the manager as I explained.  The tone was like the kid was very ashamed of my behavior.  It was freaking weird.  Maybe the kid was just in a bad spot between me and his manager.  I had no animosity and apologized for my part in the mis-understanding.  They, however, did not.\n\nAll of my visits there ... well over 100 in the last few years. Most times with a to-go order for dinner after I ate lunch there.  All of my recommendations to others and positive online reviews.  Let's not forget the tips that are always in the 35% range even on a take-out order. \n\nI will not go there again.  I thought for a moment that I would go there an pay them for the Pad Thai and tell them to shove it as I walked out, but that is not worth the effort.  I must say, I have never been treated like that by a restaurant, much less a restaurant where I am a semi-regular.  Off-hand, I cannot think of a single business (aside from car dealers) that has ever gotten on my wick like these folks.  I am still shocked and very uncomfortable at the tone of the kid.  I get it, they run a business, but that was a bit much for a single menu item.  They spent more in wages shaming me than they lost on the dish.  They obviously value their customers less than the $5 cost of an menu item due to  a dropped call and subsequent misunderstanding.\n\nI guess Chon Thai in Chandler will be my go to place for Thai food.  They have better food and the best customer service I have encountered in many years.\n\nI officially cannot, in good conscience, recommend Thai Patio, as they have lost sight of their singular goal ... customer service.",

At about 2 AM on such a night, warming oneself at the fire pit with a gigantic plate full of nachos is pretty much an unparalleled delight.\n\nThe blue and pink neon is a little too bright, but it gives the Lounge a character no other place has.  I could do without the flat screens playing Phish and the like, but you can't win 'em all.  The drinks are a little pricey, ($7 for a well drink, $9 and up for specialties) but you ARE on the Strip and you're paying for that awesome fire pit too.  (That gas bill must be outrageous.)  The waitresses are always very polite and prompt, and their dresses make me giggle just a little bit.  (Long, black cocktail dresses look somehow out of place and perfectly comfortable there at the same time.)  The Peppermill is really the only place worth lounging at for a local on the Strip anymore, so let's keep it on the downlow and keep the tourists away, shall we?  Shhhhh!",

The spoon stuck in my ice cream still did not budge even near the end of my eating. I had the premium base with cinnamon toast crunch and then added some choc. chips. Two cups of ice cream was about 12 bucks, but it was filling. Of course, watching the smoke or steam rise during the making of your ice cream was fun to boot. They should ban smoking outside at the tables because good ice cream and cigarette smoke do not go together at all.",

I like the space, and sure the staff is cute (in a sort of frat-boy/porn star way), but I need good food with my eye candy.\n\nThings I have tried: 1) the chicken soft tacos -- no flavor and HEAVY on the purple cabbage. 2) loaded mac n cheese -- I prefer the mac n cheese at Switch, hands down. 3) buffalo chicken sandwich -- decent taste, but a total mess to eat.",

But since it's one of Pittsburgh's famous food attractions, it's an experience a person should try at least once.\n\nFIrst time I ordered the cheesesteak (minus the cheese) with an extra egg on top. Never had fries in a sandwich before and I liked that the coleslaw had no mayo. Fried eggs always makes sandwiches 10x better.\n\nSecond time I ordered the pastrami. Didn't enjoy it as much as the cheesesteak. For some reason, I couldn't stomach the fries and coleslaw this time around. The coleslaw started having a weird taste after a few bites and the fries were just weird and soggy. Mixed together with the squishy pastrami, definitely wasn't as good of an experience as my first time here.\n\nStill, definitely come here, especially if you're hungry and need an outrageously large sandwich for a cheap price. It's like two meals in one.",

They have a small patio out back with nice furniture and a few yard games, like cornhole. They have good live music on weekends, and it's a GREAT place to watch any type of game, because there are a ton of TVs. They're also pretty active in the community, frequently participating in or sponsoring different events. The owner is also often behind the bar himself, which I love. Finally, the patio is dog friendly and they even have a large water bowl outside.\n\nNotice I haven't mentioned food or service yet. The food is only so-so, pretty typical bar food, and it's pricey. Some dishes have an interesting twist, like the cactus spinach dip, but everything is $3-4 higher than anywhere else. A basket of pretzel bites is almost $14 - that's steep.\n\nService is also always eh. Not horrible, but not wonderful. The impression we've always gotten is that we'll be taken care of simply because we have to be and only the bare minimum will be done. Literally on every visit, we've experienced little things like our stacked up dirty plates being left on the table even after our check has been delivered, or an empry glass being left even after a new beer is brought over. That stuff goes a long way! \n\nWe will/do still occasionally come in, as it's close and we do like watching sports here.",

It shares the parking with a few businesses and it gets pretty busy during lunch so sometimes there aren't any parking right in front and you might have to park farther. Also getting in and out might take long.\n\nWhen I come here I usually get the pho with everything except the meatballs and tripe, just not a fan of it. I think it's the #21 on the menu rare eye round steak, flank, brisket, soft tendon, skirt flank. All of that with the various veggie ingredients and sauces makes a good meal very tasty.\n\nServices is usually good. It's cluttered near the entrance. Seat a good numbers of people. There's a sign that says $10 minimum for credit charges but noticed that they aren't always strict about that policy. \n\nI don't always like eating here cause sometimes it doesn't feel so clean.",

The chicken was very tender and juicy and the skin tasted just right! The real star of the show here are those waffles! Damn! So freaking good! Add some maple syrup and some strawberry butter and wow! Definitely coming back for more of those!\n\nThe beef tips were tasty and tender and the mushroom sauce was thick and delicious! The mashed potatoes were great too! Nice and thick and fluffy. Very good. \n(-) The only item I wasn't a fan of were the cheesy tots. Think of the sour onion ruffles chip flavor mixed with hash browns. Sounds better on paper than it actually is IMO. \n(+) Service was friendly and accommodating and everyone we interacted with was smiling. Drinks were always topped off before running out. Could not ask for better service. \n(-) I honestly don't even know if this is Metro Diner's responsibility with all the other business' around, but the real problem I ran into was all the garbage in the parking lot. A bit surprising considering how new the area is. I accidentally ran over a beer bottle(??) while backing out.

Buffet at The Palms, it was from a young female server supporting a large Lobster dish in her other hand that Nobu's famous Miso Sea Bass was soon 'presented,' little more than \"eat the Ginger last to cleanse the palate\" stated as she scampered off and the $40 filet with a $2 surcharge for \"Dry Miso Style\" still quite good but certainly not as special as when it debuted nearly twenty-five years ago.\n\nAdding insult to injury with a $12 California Roll and Nigiri featuring over-sweetened and mushy Rice below $6 slices of average Albacore and Fluke, it was finally copping Michel Bras' 1981 recipe for \"Lava Cake\" that dinner came to an end, the Chocolate undoubtedly of good quality as was the bitter-sweet Gelato but the $260 tab more a reminder of precisely why Nobu is rich than a justifiable expense to sit in a \"cool\" place eating below-average Food.\n\nONE AND A HALF STARS:  No doubt making a mistake in ordering pseudo-Chef's Choice, a server barely old enough to drink and his staff of runners who could care less about things like empty water glasses or lingering dirty plates hardly someone to trust as there is no monetary \"value\" in the Tasting versus ordering a la carte, one must thank Chef Matsuhisa for his contributions and ability to both build and maintain an empire, though for discerning diners there is nothing to see here and there has not been for years.",

The potatoes were soft and delicious. The tortilla was just a wrap holding all the tasty things inside. It was not too much not too little it was just right. It was breakfast and our waiter told us we could order appetizers. Donut-holes! I think they were actually aebleskivers, but who really knows how to pronounce that for breakfast! They were really good. The came with dipping sauces. Raspberry (my favorite), caramel (Brad's favorite) and chocolate. The first two were quite good. Surprisingly the chocolate was not as good.  Everyone has their own tastes. It was hot and it was only 9:30 in the morning, but you can order beer in Phoenix. Brad tried the bottle of Grand Canyon Brewing. It was a coffee stout (I hope I got that right). Brad said it was smooth and the coffee was perfect. We are looking for this here locally, but nothing has turned up yet. Our server was quite good. I thing his name is Jash? Anyway he was great. His suggestions were right on. I almost forgot. Jash told us about the \"chile\" that comes with the burrito. I told him I liked it HOT, so he recommended a HOT read sauce. Brad likes a milder spice so he suggested the green sauce. WOW! Though it is not Hatch, it was really good. My noise was sniffling after I finished. The mild red we both decided was not to our liking. The portions are HUGE. We had breakfast again the next day. Next time we have a plan. We are going to share a burrito and french toast. That should be good enough for us. Oh and of course we worked up on appetite walking thru the gardens. We will definitely be back.",

It's a great neighborhood Italian restaurant and they are always packed with lots of locals. One of my favorite things is the free all-you-can-eat bread and salad with your meal. Second thing is I love the community feel this place has. Most of the tables are round and salad comes out in a big bowl that you pass around. They really promote family here. Popular dishes include their steamed clams, baked RigaTony, deep dish lasagna and stuffed ravioli. If you want to try a bit of everything, get the Tour of RigaTony's (a sample of some their favorites like chicken picatta, baked manicotti & fettuccino alfredo). They also have some gluten-free options as well. Like I said, there is usually is a wait. But they have a bar area you can grab a glass of wine and mix and mingle while waiting. They also have a mini store in the front with some fun gimmicky toys and Italian grocery items like pasta or olives you can take home. The service for me has always been excellent. I've been trying new dishes and recently had the Chicken Cutlets Piccata and loved it. If you want an appetizer, I recommend their shrimp and pesto bruschetta. For decor, they have many photos of people that have visited here over the years that adorn the walls. RigaTony's plays a part in the community by donating meals to local organizations like Paz de Cristo and Tempe Community Action Center to feed the homeless.",

So delicious. Add the little spicy red seasoning, sesame seeds, oil and vinegar, and you got yourself a gem. Even without all those things, a plain and simple ramen is DELIICIOUS.

The gentleman had such an attitude and didn't want to seat us because one member of our party wasn't there, even though we wanted to order drinks and appetizers in the meantime (we were absolutely ravenous). We finally convinced him to seat us. Mind you, the place was practically empty at the time (5:30pm on a Tuesday). The hostess was nice though and made up for it somewhat although she did mess up my order. I wanted to get fatty tuna sashimi style and 2 salmon sushi style but it came out reversed which was annoying but not annoying enough to warrant sending it back (again, super hungry). The fatty tuna was unremarkable and disappointing given the hefty $15 price tag and I've had much better elsewhere. Their pork bao buns were not at all what I expected (the pork was baked into a pastry type bun rather than being a large sliver of pork in a taco-style bun like literally every other place serves). Lastly, I tried a piece of my coworkers sushi and for the price, it was absolutely unremarkable. There was no noticeable flavor profile and it lacked a much needed texture. Again, extremely overpriced for what unimaginative flavorless roll was on the plate. Only thing I can say was good was the edamame and the decor (although rather dark). Perhaps the nightclub is more worthwhile...",

While good on its own, this pizza came to life w/ many dashes of roasted red pepper flakes, oregano, and parmesan cheese.  The thin-crust didn't fare so well- it was soggy before you could say \"cheese\" (pardon the pun!), but I managed.  \n\nToo bad this pizzeria doesn't serve wine...

I guess you can say it doesn't sound very nice to say, but the food here is my favorite Vietnamese cuisine. I'm not a huge fan of the pho but I'm a very big fan of their vermicelli noodle bowls! It's the perfect amount of food for someone with a middle sized appetite. They're open late night so if you're out on the strip with your friends or are looking for a late night snack (hardly the size for a snack), Mr. Pho Kim Long is your best bet to satisfy your Vietnamese craving.\n\nThe service isn't super because of the lack of personality their staff has but they bring your food out fairly quick. Does one base service on how quick you get to eat or how pleasant they make your visit? I say it depends on both but lucky for Pho Kim Long, their service is very fast and consistent.  It wouldn't hurt the staff to crack a smile or two, crack a joke, or laugh even. They don't have a problem splitting your checks as long as they get their money.  The atmosphere is very traditionally Asian and being of Asian descent, it doesn't do much for me.  In other words, you wont catch me with my iPhone in hand snapping shots like some tourist or something. Maybe, the food for Yelp but that's all ;)\n\nNever had a problem customer service-wise, always accommodated the big groups of friends I go everywhere with, and doesn't take log to bring what you ask for. That's a big thing for me when the server takes the detour to bring you something you've asked for. And having to ask for it twice really peeves me but as busy and as impersonable as their staff is, they go and get what you ask for right away. Maybe to get you to go faster? If I wanted to be In -n- Out of a joint, I'd go get a burger! Hahaha! Go for the pork vermicelli, add the sauce they give you with some of the oyster (brown) sauce and a bit of the hot sauce and you'll be good!

So I called, and asked if this was possible.  The person (girl) who answered said in a very haughty voice that it was their policy to have no less than 24 hours notice for all special orders, but if I wanted to come and buy them out of the case, I was more than welcome.  I asked if it would be possible to put two dozen aside so that we could pick them up, and even offered to pay for them up front over the phone.  The response? \"Um, I'm sorry ma'am, but we don't reserve cupcakes.\"  Very well.  In person it is...\n\nMy boss went in on a lunch break only to be told that the policy did not apply to their mini cupcakes; that unless he pre-ordered his mini cupcakes a day in advance (too late) they were not allowed to sell him more than six of the same flavor of mini cupcake, and that buying such a large amount of the same flavor in mini cupcakes was \"not allowed.\"  NOT ALLOWED??  Is it illegal for you to actually SELL the cupcakes you bake or in the rules of your franchising are you prohibited from selling them and, oh, I don't know, ATTEMPTING to turn a profit and help your would-be clients?!\n\nI'm not sure about anyone else in this industry, but I would go out on a limb and make the crazy assumption that actually SELLING the freshly baked items one makes in a day by the END of the day would be one's sole goal... The fact that Gigi's would NOT do this?  Well... it makes me question the sanity of whoever is pulling the strings of this particular bake shop.  \n\nTo end the story... he went to the bakery at Harris Teeter.  They were more than happy to sell him two dozen of the same flavor of mini-cupcakes.  From now on, I will take our business (and any other cupcake business I encounter) to ANY OTHER CUPCAKE PLACE IN CHARLOTTE.",

What kind of half-assed place doesn't even bother with the little extra effort to do that?\n\nMeanwhile, the whole restaurant/shop smelled extremely fishy (think fish tank that hasn't been cleaned in 3 years) and I personally saw flies landing on the fish that a guy was cutting up when he would walk away to grab something. Uhhhh... nasty! \n\nThey've also discontinued the all-you-can-eat sushi Wednesdays citing the Tokyo Nuclear incident as the reason. Really? But buying rolls piecewise is okay? Shouldn't the shop shut down if they are so concerned?\n\nAnd finally, I am not sure if this next point is a positive or a negative for readers, but I will mention it in case anyone finds it informative: the cashier/waitresses all have these low-cut tops where their anatomy is nearly falling out.

The signatory yellow light fixtures corresponded with a good number of round tables. The structure also facilitated a row of stools facing the large windows, and a full bar in the back. By extension, the sidewalk patio added character and spaciousness to the restaurant. Fortunately, we arrived early enough and did not have to wait for a table.\n\nThe Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup ($7.50) came with a conventional bread and cheese sandwich, tomato soup, and hash brown. There was a light crunch on the bread, but not enough cheese to translate into that gooey experience I was looking for. For the price, I was expecting better value and taste on the sandwich. The tomato soup was rich, hearty, and had a slight kick in the end. The hash brown was soft and needed more crispy edges. It was not the best grilled cheese, but it did hit the spot.\n\nThe Pancake Flight ($9) came with our choice of blueberry pancake, sweet potato pancake, and the chocolate ganache pancake. All three of us agreed the sweet potato pancake was the most impressive, as the buttermilk and caramel flavors accompanied a touch of ginger butter and handfuls of pecans tossed on top. The server endorsed the blueberry pancake, but it tasted rather conventional. I wished there were wholesome blueberries embedded, and that these pancakes were easier to cut into. The dark chocolate ganache concoction was without depth and the least impressive.\n\nService was very sporadic and not warm or welcoming as I expected of breakfast places. Overall, the food were nowhere close to the experience I previously had at their sister restaurants. The food hit the spot but there was no wow factor whatsoever. Additionally, I thought the execution on the Grilled Cheese was very poor for the price and a restaurant of this caliber. The server also gave approval to a blueberry pancake that was rather sub par. Overhyped. I will not be coming back.",

The dish comes out with chewy cold noodles. (Good noodles but I thought they were going to be hot so completely threw off my balance of the meal). Instead of a broth it comes with a dipping sauce. It is also not spicy by any means. The noodle to protein portion is very skewed. You end up with more noodles than pork. The whole experience was very underwhelming and just left me waiting for my bf to finish eating so I could get the heck out of here. At first I was going to try their Japanese pancake ice cream. But after such a lack of warmth and disappointment in the noodles probably won't come here again. If you're going to try this place out. Don't be a first timer, know what to order or ask.

We eat out on average three times per week, and love to try new places, so we've been exposed to lots of different settings... this place looked really nice, and I was excited about the menu. \nLong story short: we were there over an hour and a half for lunch - we were using a groupon, the table seated next to us about 10 minutes after us was served and gone and my husband got his entree... actually he never received his entree. He ordered the beef burger. A full hour after we arrived, I was half way finished with my entree and the server came to tell my husband that they were out of hamburgers and presented him with a meatball sandwich. WTF??? first - don't tell me I like meatball sandwiches because I like burgers, and second, ASK me what I would like if you run out of something - preferably within a few minutes of ordering... \nMy poor hubby never got any food, we waited 15 more minutes for a turkey panini to go... the \"manager\" came by to let us know they were barely cutting the turkey for the sandwich if we wanted to keep waiting. We left. Will absolutely NEVER return to this place. \nWhile I understand they were busy because the groupon expired the following day, I also understand planning and logistics, and this was just ridiculous.  RIDICULOUS I say!",

I enjoyed the burger, but for the $12 I spent, there are just other places to go around here.

After I ordered, I checked in and received my free baklava, a Mediterranean pastry. The food came out quickly after.\n\nThe gyro was great and I loved the sauce that came with it. Their fries also tasted fresh and were seasoned very well. The only thing is, I wish the portions were a bit bigger for a $10 combo. It was filling enough, but I'm not sure if it was completely worth it. I will say I loved the taste of the chicken. It has a good smokey flavor and you can see that they make it fresh when you're ordering.\n\nOverall, this place has my thumbs up. They make me want to  try other Greek joints and see if they can compare to Stephano's. I give this place a solid 4 stars, and I would bump it to a 5, but as I said earlier, it is a bit pricey.",

Although the mussels were small the sauce and cheeses croutons were incredible. I took advantage of all the various breads they had in the basket just to dip in the sauce and\nIndulge more. \n\nFor dinner I had the Hawaiian tuna served sashimi style. It was seared with Asian inspired flavors and didn't make you feel so heavy. I will say that it is a quite a portion and initially seeing it can be overwhelming. \nThey warn about the size of the side portions so please think it through or else you will have way too much. I had a table of 4 and we battled to eat everything cause it was yummy but man I came out of there a fatty wack. I LOVED the Cream corn and Alaskan Crab truffle gnocchi. Done deal with those two! I had the lobster mash and yes it had big chunks of lobsters and it was good but not as great as it's hype was. We also had saut\u00e9ed broccoli and honestly it looked steamed. They serve you the sides which I thought was a great service. \n\nThey gave us their signature butter cake. Topped with ice cream and fresh fruit with a side of whipped cream. If you even last this long to have dessert then order it. Warning-the portion is again good for 3-4 person so think it through before you order. \n\nI would highly recommended this place. It's ambiance is okay because it still does feel like you are still in the shopping area even though you can't see it too much. Great service and great food. You really can't go wrong.",

The restaurant itself is very hip when you walk in and doesn't give off that usual Asian sit-down vibe like the other restaurants in the area.  District One has a feeling of hanging out, and should be a go-to Happy Hour spot for some of the food.  Drinks aren't cheap though, so keep that in mind.\n\nI had the meatball pho, pork buns, and chicken wings.  Meatball pho was just ok.  I know I should have gone for one of their flagship oxtail or bone marrow phos, but I messed up - shame on me.  The chicken wings had a nice kick but were all in all ordinary Asian wings.  The pork buns were amazing.  The bun, the meat, the filling, all top notch.  Come during Happy Hour for a great deal and get a few orders of them.\n\nThe complaints are long; if it wasn't for the solid food and the ultimate finale of our situation, I would have given 2 stars for sure.  First off, after being immediately seated in an almost empty restaurant at about 5pm, the waiter took 10 minutes just to take our order.  He brought over a different beer than what we asked for and then when we placed our order, it took 40 minutes to come out, all at the same time, not staggered as appetizers and mains should be.  Apparently the kitchen gave our order to another table which just blows my mind because no way somebody ordered our exact dishes.  But the worst part was that no waiter came by to check up on us during this 40 minutes without food, even with empty beer up to that point.  We ultimately just packed our appetizers in to-go boxes straight away and only ate the pho at the restaurant because we were in a hurry.  The waitress comped both appetizers, which is nice, but still doesn't make up for the previous 45 minute meal experience.",

I should have gotten right back in the car and left - it was too telling of things to come. \n\nIt was 2 o'clock (6/21/11.) The place was a ghost town. We weren't entirely sure it was even open when we pulled up. I had already driven all over town with my sister looking for places to eat. After coming up short, we were going to Macaroni Grill, on principle. After braving the rank smell out in the parking lot, we went inside. There were a total of three tables with people at them. After standing around for a good couple of minutes, our soon-to-be waiter (D. name protected) seated us and handed me a ripped up menu.\n\nMan, I hate it when I wear a dress and there are crumbs all over the booth seat because they scratch the back of my legs. The seat was covered in the sharpest, diamond-cutting crumbs - and the server didn't remove the extra place settings. \n\nSpeaking of crumbs, another waiter brought out our waters and bread, or \"prison food\" as he called it. Prison food was right! We were brought out what looked like a loaf of bread, but was actually a gigantic crouton. Yeah, for those who don't cook - don't heat up bread, especially at a restaurant, in a microwave. It turns it damn near rock solid. This bread had clearly been microwaved. Trying to break the bread required us each to look in the other direction, you know like you have to do when pulling the little confetti fireworks, so you don't pull out an eye. We had to do that with the bread lest we get a scratched cornea with a shard of bread.\n\nI ordered the porcini mushroom ravioli and my sister ordered the Pizza Margherita. Both looked great when they came out. Look, I love mushrooms - mushrooms, onion and garlic is akin to my personal \"mirepoix.\" This, this... \"dish,\" was awful! Never in my life had I needed to force myself to eat anything with mushrooms in it until today. The sauce was the consistency of milk.  Just awful. The pizza my sister ordered was so thin and floppy, all the toppings slid right off. Never mind that it was completely void of any flavor, both meals were barely palatable.\n\nAfter sitting for nearly 20 minutes with half full plates of food, the waiter FINALLY told my sister he'd get boxes. Another 10 minutes later, he arrived with the box and the check. It took another 10 minutes for him to pick up the check. \n\nGood gawd, everything was awful. Never again!",

Blackened is supposed to be very flavorful people!  The fish chunks tasted like stale, warm, low-sodium canned tuna with a hint of, I don't know, garlic powder maybe??  It had a smear of avocado, a few shreds of white cabbage, a few shreds of cheese and a drizzle of \"white cilantro sauce\" which was so scant that I couldn't even taste it.  It was decoration, I guess.\nFor my 1 side I chose the refried beans.  Yuk!  Tastes like cheap canned beans.  I ordered a dos XX special lager on tap and it was flat and watered down.  Even the beer was a hot mess.  And here I am in shock!  I'm not quite sure what all the hype is about. This place was not very good at all.  And I don't plan on going again.  Ever!

However, the food was tasty enough to receive 5 stars.\n\nI ordered the lunch entree Cashew with chicken. It was seriously amazing. I enjoyed it in the lobby cafe of my place of work. A nice lady even asked where I had gotten my lunch from. I was only into my second bite when she asked.. then she kindly said \"I'll let you finish your meal\"\n\nMy entree came with chicken, red peppers, onions, carrots, broccoli in a sweet chili sauce.. Oh & rice + 1 Rangoon. On the phone, they asked for my preference of spiciness. Since the sauce was already sweet chili, I thought it was already have a kick. The sauce itself was mild. Next time I'll add a little spice to it. \n\nWith that being said, even those who can't enjoy spicy food can enjoy Nicky's. For instance, the security guard who also chatted with me during my lunch brought up that his stomach cant handle spicy. I informed his that the sauce was honestly mild and you can choose the level of hotness you'd like.\n\nI will definitely be back to enjoy lunch here (most likely take out due to my lunch schedule) My fiance would most likely love Nicky's  as well!! We'll head here for dinner one night and I will update.",

        "text": "Went back a couple days ago. (The last 3 times I gotta say they were 5 star occasions too bad I forgot to update my review to reflect so) To our surprise they HAVE CHANGED THEIR MENU. I doubt Oreganos is suffering financially but it looks like the changes on their menu is to try to get an extra 20 cents off every dollar. We also noticed their quality went down(could of been a one off situation) but as you can see from my pictures their wings were horrible, the one thing I come for was horrible :-( the sauce was the same but the wings themselves seemed to be attacked by a pack of dogs or exposed to radiation because they looked  deformed and tiny. I would of not complained to the waitress but each wing is $1.00 now so you gotta get what you paid for. They ended up replacing 3 of the(I had eaten some as I was hungry) ones the manager saw but by the time they came back out we were done eating. Manager said quality had not eaten but as you can see my picture it tells otherwise.\n\nThe pizza.(Chicago pan not deep dish) had a real weird texture and seem uncooked. At that time we were done complaining so we just ate it. By the way they only have their signatures for the thin crust on the menu but if you remember your favorite from deep dish or pan they will make it for you. Seems like they are trying to promote build your own and pay for each topping individually.\n\nI feel like Oreganos is trying to aim towards gourmet modern restaurant. Which kind of takes away from what Oreganos is. \n\nNext time we crave Oreganos we are driving to camelback location hopefully they are still the same.",

Plates are served with beans (okay)and cilantro lime rice, which is a nice change to the normal Mexican rice. \n\nThe chicken lettuce tacos were also very good. At first I was hesitant to order them, fearing it wouldn't be enough to fill the belly.  The tacos are large and served with diced chicken in bib lettuce with some toppings. As it turns out, they are actually quite filling and delicious. A hungry male might be inclined to order a street taco on the side, but it should be plenty for the average gal. \n\nThe empanadas weren't extraordinary, and for the price it wasn't much. I probably wouldn't order this item again. \n\nThe flan was definitely the standout item here. I would forgo the appetizer and save room for this instead! \n\nThey serve red and green salsa with the chips (first basket is complimentary), both are yummy. They also have (had?) a spicy habanero salsa. When I first started coming here it was served with the chips- but the last couple of times it hasn't been. Not sure if you have to ask for it now or it was taken off of the menu?  \n\nService here isn't the greatest, thus the -1 star. I've been here several times when they are busy and slow. Its always a crapshoot. They forget to go orders, take a long to take customer order, etc. \n\nOverall, you won't be disappointed with the food. It's tasty and the organic aspect makes you feel good about eating it. It's a bit expensive, but locals get a discount on certain days. If the wait staff can step up their game, it's easily 5/5 stars.",

More time missed off the clock running around during a work day. Had to drive back to get what we paid for\n\nSecond time they almost gave us one order for free but being the kind hearted honest hard working type we told them they had to charge us for one of the orders. This comes with after waiting for 20 minutes to get wings we ordered 30 minutes prior online for pickup. They stated that one of their cooks did not show up for work or called out.\n\nTonight was the last straw though. We ordered online again and I wanted dry rub on the side of my salt and vinegar order. I ordered garlic parm as they put that sauce on the side as well despite the clarification made in the ticket under the notes field on the website. Anyhow.... I also chose to get one Bleu cheese with my take out in which I did not get. All and all....  I am just tired of the complete lack of paying attention to small details. I am not sure how they have such a high ratings here but I am convinced and I will not eat here again just because of the amount of mistakes that happen over and over.

I decided to try a full meal from PDQ after enjoying one of their chicken tenders at the Yelp SEAlife event.\n\nI had no idea where this place was in relation to the Mills, so I did drive around a little bit before finally finding it (thanks to my GPS app). It's right across the Academy store, if you happen to know the layout of the area better than myself.\n\nI walked in and was surprised at how spacious it was. It was pretty packed in the seating area but there was no line. I walked right up and ordered a chicken tenders salad and beverage. Total cost of my meal came right under $8. The beverages are self-serve. They have the ubiquitous coca cola machine but I went the half unsweet/half sweet tea combo. Unfortunately, I was very dissatisfied with the taste of their tea and regretted my beverage choice.\n\nThey call out your order via microphone so be sure you're paying attention while deciding which coca cola combination you want to fill your cup with. I wasn't blown away by my salad. It was just OK.\n\nI plan on going back to try their chicken tenders meal (although my friend who I went with stated those were just ok as well) but I would recommend PDQ as a better alternative than what's found in the mall food court.",

Unless you are cutting my food and stuffing it in my mouth, I am not going to give you a tip for walking a pizza 10 feet away to me at the table.\n\nMENU: won't do toppings on only half the pizza, two meat topping limit even though they offer 4 kinds of meat toppings.\n\nTHE PIZZA: This pizza was a disgrace. The meat pizza was a soggy mess that left an pile of oil and grease on the paper plate (see my uploaded photos). The regular cheese pizza didn't have enough cheese on it. It only covered 15% of the pie, the rest was all sauce showing. \n\nTHE STAFF: We were asked on 3 separate occasions if we wanted more sauce to dip our crust in. How about this- why don't you figure out how to put together a pizza that has the correct ratio of dough to sauce to cheese!\n\nDefinitely not going back and definitely not recommending.\n\nADT'L NOTES AFTER JENNIFER OF INIZIO COMMENTED ON MY REVIEW:\nI appreciate Jennifer of Inizio correcting me on my size of Coke ordered, but that additional 4 ounces of soda still doesn't justify the $50 price tag. There are currently 12,500 Domino's Pizza stores. if no one liked their pizza, there simply wouldn't be that many stores open. I have visited Italy and have eaten pizza in Rome, Venice, Naples, Sorrento, and the Island of Capri and Inizio's pizza didn't taste like anything I ate in Italy. The taste of their pizza was pretty bland and very soggy. I stand by my review and am pretty clear with the issues of this restaurant. I didn't just say. 'this place is crap so don't there'. I took the time to itemize it with 4 problems areas and included photos. Yelp exists to give unbiased and honest reviews by people and I am entitled to my opinion. Jennifer's final sentence of \"You are definitely not the customer we want dining with us\" is definitely a buyer beware to future patrons on how they treat customers.\n\nI have since had Jennifer send me a private message inviting me to Inizio for some free gelato! Last week you don't want me, this week you welcome me with open arms! When I messaged her about it, she replied that she meant to send that message to another Andrea on Yelp. The pizza was bad enough, now I have to deal with this foolishness.....",

My coworkers ordered the Carson Bisque & Toast ($13) which looked enough for someone who wasn't too hungry and the 7th St. Ham + Cheese Toast. ($11) which looked like a unique take on a much more rich ham & cheese sandwich and looked filling.\n\nThe service was great and the owner spoke with us a bit about his spot. The restaurant had a flag from Ireland so I'm assuming if it isn't pride, that maybe some of the food is inspired from there. I could be totally wrong, but what does that matter?! The food was delicious!!!\n\nThe owner said happy hour is from 5-6pm for $5 cocktails and beer. So we'll be back one day after work for that. They have a different menu for brunch and dinner, which I'll have to try another day. \n\nThere's street parking you pay for and I believe a parking lot behind the building.

Now, I've had my share of pulled pork sandwiches, and for a place that doesn't specialize in barbecue meats, MSCo makes a damn good one. The pork is juicy and the horseradish aoli really brings out the flavor in the meat. I devoured it. Oh, and did I mention that MSCo also makes a mean iced chai latte? Because they do. It is delish! :9\n\nAfter lunch, I snuck away with a few baked goodies as well...a brownie and a sourdough baguette. Neither made it home in one piece. \n\nI don't typically have a huge sweet tooth, but I caved at the truffle-like consistency of the brownie. Each bite practically melted in my mouth..and as hard as I tried to save half of it for my friend, the entire brownie was safely tucked away in my belly before I even pulled into my parking spot at home. Oops. \n\nThe baguette was another winner. I like my sourdough bread sour - but not overwhelmingly so - and MSCo's was perfection.

        "text": "It's Monday, people! What are you all doing here?\n\nThat's what I wanted to scream as I asked the gentleman at the bar how long the wait was.\n\nThere aren't that many tables stuffed into this small establishment, but apparently they really are that good that people are willing to waste time that they will never get back, to eat here.\n\nSo, I stepped outside and summarily informed my wife as to the long wait. I also reminded her that the other places she chose the past two days had prolonged delays for seating. I felt like I had lost precious moments in my life waiting to eat. On the upside, I was spending time with the only person that matters, so it was not even remotely a total loss in time. I was simply exaggerating.\n\nSo we waited outside, and tried to engage all the other customers. But, everyone was agitated for having to wait, and no one was wanting to engage in random conversation. In fact, the leaders of each party kept going back inside asking how much longer they would have to wait. I thought it was funny because we were all blocking the front entrance and we would've seen anyone that would've left. So, why bother asking how much longer? Duh!\n\nI also thought how funny it was when a couple would leave, and the groups would go back inside and check in. Lemme do some basic math for you, okay? 2 people leave, and there are 10 of all you all! How many seats do you think will be available? :)\n\nSo, I go inside (not to ask how much longer), but I grabbed a menu (why waste time waiting in line and not be prepared), and I commandeer the only remaining flan in the house. I go back outside, and I tell my wife that I reserved the flan. She was a little perturbed because she didn't think I could do that! Well, everyone else is harassing the 2 servers (and one of them is pregnant), and I was just being polite and proactive. I kindly asked if I could have the last flan, and the gentleman set it aside for me.\n\nSo, about 50 minutes into the long wait, we finally get a seat. I must say, we really did experience how small this place was because as mobility was definitely impaired when you eat here. There is no chance that you won't bump into ANYONE! \n\nLet's get to the food part. The variety of Salsa that this place offers is amazing. Their unique flavors, and various combinations thereof are fantastic. You can mix and match them, and they just make you that much hungrier with every bite. \n\nWe had the Sonora Carne Asada Burro and the Street Tacos. Additionally, we also had the Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken Quesa. \n\nThe verdict? Definitely worth the wait. The meats and the sauces were just phenomenal. Each and every bite was wonderful.\n\nThen for the finale, I had my flan. By that time, everyone in our original group was seated and were still in various stages of being served with either drinks or their food orders being taken.\n\nWhen the pregnant server lady brought out our flan, EVERYONE looked at it with envy as it really was a delicious masterpiece. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Then everyone wanted to order it, but alas, they all found out that I ordered the last one!!! (Evil eyes across the room)\n\nMore evil eyes came because I quickly learned how to multitask the server lady. While she was getting our flan, I went ahead and gave her my CC, asked for boxes for our leftovers, and also asked for refills.\n\nSo, while she was gone for quite some time preparing our flan, she left the only other server to take care of everyone else. When she returned, she had our box, our refills, our flan, and our check all done.\n\nAll we had to do was enjoy the flan, drink our refills, box up our leftovers, and sign the check / fill out her tip. \n\nAnd we walked out of there, while everyone was still wondering how to get served in here.\n\nA few things that may detract from future experiences that you may want to be aware of. There is minimal parking, so you have to park on the side street but don't block the homes. The wait is long, and the service is slow unless you learn how to stack your requests so they get stuff done in one trip.\n\nOtherwise, what a wonderful dining experience, even for a Monday night!\n\n(Gosh, how I missed it when Monday Night Football was going on. I never had to endure this during those times)",

Let me set the scene - nice ambiance, attentive service, zero vegan options.  Lots of vegetarian, but nothing vegan (with the possible exception of a salad.)  However, our server was on the ball and they rustled up some egg-free pasta in the back of the kitchen and left the ricotta off the linguine pomodoro.  \n\nI had the pasta ($19) and a glass of Sangiovese ($14), which made for about a $40 dinner with tax, tip, etc.  The pasta was pretty delicious I will say.  Definitely high quality tomatoes, olive oil.  Very simple but well executed.  But I felt like I didn't have $40 worth of dinner.  \n\nBottom line - not worth it to me to pay that much for that little, but I would gladly go again if someone else were footing the bill or if I got in on the 1/2 off locals deal that Adina mentions below.  \n\nEveryone else in my party raved about their food, so if you eat eggs and cheese, you'll probably enjoy the food and feel like you're getting your money's worth.",

Voila, it works masterfully -- you get a crowded place with a long wait for service and if you're really unlucky, like us, an even more Egg-&-I-zingly long wait for your food. \n\nMy family and I sat for 1 hour, 47 minutes waiting for our order. Kid you not. I know this because I received a text message just before placing our order and the time stamp never lies. The waiter and manager compensated us not with a free entree or a comped check, but with one free cinnamon roll to split among the four of us and free refills of nasty diner coffee while we waited. Gracious.\n\nSince it pains me to write reviews like this, I will say the food was OK when we finally got it. Then again, after waiting almost 2 hours, we devoured it like the pack of hangry wolves we were. The eggs could have been rotten and we'd have been none the wiser but honestly, and to be fair, everything tasted A-OK.",

The beef brisket sandwich literally melts in your mouth the way it should. Topped with pickle and white onion. The Dirty Fries are breaded potato wedges topped with chunked brisket Cheese Whiz fresh jalape\u00f1os and onions. Those fries are a meal alone. Variety of BBQ sauces, my favorite being the Seasonal.

Our waiter introduced himself, took our drink orders, then left. A few minutes pass and another waiter comes up, introduces himself, and takes our drink orders. No mention is made as to why the first waiter left, etc. For any business to be successful, you have to communicate and manage expectations, and Egg Works failed in this one simple transition of wait staff. \n\nIt was our first time (and last), and neither of our two waiters explained the \"egg\" thing (where you have to flip it over to get service). (another failure of communication). \n\nAbout our actual food, that was sub-par too. I ordered a waffle works with a waffle, sausage patty, and over easy eggs. My mom ordered a spinach benny. I could've made everything at home and it would've tasted better had I made it at home. Eggs had none of that cooked in buttery goodness that you expect at a restaurant, eggs were underdone even for an over easy because there was still that albumin in there. My waffle was the same kind of waffle you'd make at a continental breakfast at a motel (& dare I say it was worse than a motel waffle). And my sausage was not made on site, as they said it was. It tasted and looked like a jimmy dean frozen sausage microwaved for a minute before being put on my plate. My mothers potatoes were reheated out of a frozen bag. The Canadian ham that came with her eggs benedict had a bone in it!! Gross. Our hot sauce bottles were unopened, so I had to rip off the plastic wrapping (this shows that they don't think about the customer experience, just re-stocking the tables without concern as to how it would affect the customer). \n\nAlso, it was expensive! Our breakfast for two people was $27! There is absolutely no way I'm coming back.",

It was good. The dessert bar wasn't all that great and the seafood bar was just OK. Otherwise it was good and I gave it four stars.\nWhen I heard that the jazz brunch that used to take place at the Wynn country club would now be taking place at Lakeside, we decided to give it a try. \nI loved the jazz brunch at the country club. There was a long beautiful display buffet with fresh seafood of different varieties, an area of charcuterie and fresh bread, an area of southern choices including incredible shrimp and grits, and an area of bagels and cream cheese and lox, you could order off the menu with a lovely array of choices, and the dessert area was unreal: a vitrine incredible cakes almost like being at Payard or Jean Philippe bakeries, and the atmosphere was relaxing and calming with lovely jazz playing in the background. This was all inclusive with a price of about $68 per person and was well worth it!\nThe current brunch is not the jazz brunch that I knew! We were grossly disappointed. Quite frankly, it is now officially a rip off. There was a seafood area and it is limited but you will like it if you're into crab legs and shrimp. They bring a basket of a few breads/pastries to your table, a fruit platter, and someone comes around with a few choices of a ham and cheese grilled sandwich or a small avocado toast, both which were just OK. The bread/bakery basket was disappointing and we would have not picked up over half of what they gave us so it was a big no-no for us. The fruit platter was good. The choices up the menu that we ordered included a buckwheat and chicken cr\u00eape, a mushroom and cheddar omelette, steak frites, Lemon ricotta pancakes, and a yogurt with granola and berries. They were all just OK and that was really disappointing because nothing made me say wow or made me want to order another either now or in the future.\nThe coffee was OK and not as good as I remember it.\nThe price is $68 per person and this does not include alcohol. The price is exorbitant and simply no longer worth it.\nSo I would have given it three stars despite this, but here is why I chose to give it one star: we had reservations and we were put at a table that was pathetic. We had no view of the waterfall and it was poorly positioned. Being someone who comes to The Wynn a lot, including having been to Lakeside, I know the level of customer service expected and we were placed at a table with no view and other tables that were available with views were still empty. That was extremely disappointing. I did not feel that I needed to say anything as they should have known to sit us at a better table.\nOur waiter was, and I am not exaggerating, one of the three worst waiters I have ever had. He never came to take our order and we had to keep making eye contact with him to give him any clues. He was barely around and just provided the worst customer service possible.\nI will not be coming here and this place is getting one star because, for how expensive it is, I expect top-notch customer service, top-notch food, and a top notch environment. This time, it's failed in all three areas. Will not be going back.",

We arrived and right away it was an issue.  They didn't know whether they could seat us outside or not?  Then after several minutes they said it would be a 45 minute wait.  So we decided to be seated inside instead to avoid the wait.  From there it took our waitress forever to get us drinks.  We all orderd food and began the wait.  Food was just above par.  There was no games to be played.  When we asked about them they said there was budget cuts.  So here we are in Vegas and came to some lame place, we could have spent our 3 hours somewhere that wanted us to be there and had more fun.

We had 6.5 people in our group (4 adults, two kids, one baby), it seemed like they were unprepared for a group of more then 4...  we were seated at two tables that were pushed together and it still felt like we needed more room... \n\nThe complimentary edamame and cucumber salads that were brought out were a nice gesture, I would have appreciated water coming out first though. We made up for it by doing sake bombs, which made a bit of a mess (please get some smaller glasses, Spicy Tuna management!!)\n\nAs others have stated, this is more of a roll place... I still love well made rolls. The menu was a little intimidating, they have 86 'specialty rolls' listed so it took us a while to decide.  We finally agreed to start with: \n\nLarge Screaming Orgasm - Generous portion of seared tuna but I've had better orgasm sauces. \n\nSun Devil Roll   - I don't do jalapenos usually but  this roll had the perfect amount to give it some kick without it being too overpowering. Yumyum sauce was fantastic. Probably my favorite roll of the night. \n\nCaterpillar roll  - Came with shrimp tempura, would have liked for it to have more eel. \n\nPhilly Roll - Hard to mess up this classic. \n\nI Love Sushi Roll - Spicy tuna with more tuna on top. Not bad, not amazing. \n\nWe also ordered one plate of teriyaki chicken for the kids as well as some sodas. Total damage with tax and before tip - $130. Overall, I was happy with my meal but wasn't blown away, especially for the price paid.",

About half an hour into wait time, the hostess apologized for the wait and said that she couldn't seat us until she got the 'go ahead' from the kitchen. 10 minutes later, another woman came to the hostess and told her she could seat only 3 people at a time, and the wait one for every 3 person group was 20 minutes. I don't know what's going on with this place, but it's the second time that we've been here and they have kitchen issues.

Entrees start around $15 and the chips and salsa are not free (huge negative). \n\nLuckily, I have this handy dandy Yelp app on my phone that scored us both the free chips and salsa AND 7% off our meal, putting $2.23 back in my pocket. \n\nIt was over 100 out and yet the misters outside made it feel so nice, so for ambiance (outside), I give the place a 9. The place was quiet for a Saturday but walking in, you would've guessed we were entering an amusement park.

The menu is very very long but you can pretty much skip the whole middle section because, although they list many Vietnamese options, these are not their forte.

        "text": "Okay I need to update my review because I can't hate on a restaurant just because their food is so spicy I can't feel my mouth afterwards. In fact I actually love this about Chao Thai and I'm going to be visiting more often I think. The other main reason to go to Chao Thai over other options in the area is this: Green Curry Fried Rice. I've never seen it offered anywhere else and I guarantee that it alone is worth a try. It has all the flavors of a green curry wrapped up in a fried rice without all the soupy mess. It's almost like the spices get soaked up by the rice and it makes the dish hotter. The level 4 (out of 5) was making me sweat but it wasn't so hot I couldn't keep eating. We also ordered the tofu pad see ew and chicken panang curry. Both were good, but the tofu in the pad see ew was bland and the pieces of tofu were larger than one bite. Honestly nothing else matters but the green curry fried rice. Come here, get that, and anything else you order will be just fine. Just watch your spicy levels.",

So I know it's a trend and all, but taking $11 for one piece of toast seems insane to me. You're getting no sides with it of course, and even though it's a decent sized bred slice, it's just expensive. But, and that's the third point, it tastes great. The avo toast was super. I've had their latte too which was good. Staff was friendly, one girl recommended a specific drink which most likely I would never try without her recommended it, and it was really good. We've also had the chia seeds bowl which was ok plus. \n\nOverall - nice decor, nice environment, somewhat overpriced with good vibes.",

Top two in my book!  Friend said the risotto was the best he had ever had. After so many courses the entree was quite large. I wasn't able to finish all my food. I was very full and satisfied. We had a show to catch and the waiters were great getting us out on time.  We were not served any dessert from our menus. A little disappointed about that. Only enough time to serve the birthday cake we brought in for our celebrant.  Would love to come here again.",

        "text": "I am a fan of this small but nicely decorated Thai restaurant.  I was there for the first time--certainly not the last time--Saturday night.  I had the Yelp deal and it worked beautifully.\n\nI started with the crab stick appetizer.  Here's how the menu describes it:  Deep fried rice paper wrapped with mix crab meat & cream sauce, served with homemade plum sauce.  When I saw 6 sticks, I thought there was no way I could eat all of them and have room for dinner.  Wrong!  They were so very tasty you could never leave one to be taken away.  The plum sauce was good, and my server brought me the hot spice holder and I used some chili paste to spice up some of the sticks.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered from the Issan (northern Thailand area) part of the menu which offers foods with more spice kick.  I got the Ped Nom Tok, and the menu describes it like this:  Sliced boneless roasted duck home made with chili paste, herbs, spices & lime juice.  I asked for a spicy level of 4 out of 5.  It was spicy, but from my little array of spices, I added some extra red pepper flakes.  The dish was superb!  The mint that garnished the dish and the raw cabbage gave you something to cool your palate when the red pepper heat got to be a bit much.\n\nTime for dessert.  I had two things in mind.  Durian sticky rice or coconut ice cream.  I had been warned that the durian would cause horrendous breath.  Anthony Bourdain describes durian this way.  \"...Your breath will smell as if you'd been French-kissing your dead grandmother.\"  Since I was going to a show after dinner, I opted for the coconut ice cream.  It was the safer choice, and it was very good with some small chunks of coconut mixed in.\n\nI started dinner with a Thai iced coffee and I had an order of sticky rice.\n\nThe service was fantastic.  There were three ladies who were very attentive and answered a couple of questions I had.  I thought the one was going to say \"chicken\" when I opted out of the durian sticky rice dessert.  \n\nThe Yelp deal worked fine.  I paid $10 and received credit for $20 from Weera.  She took the code off my iPhone and asked me to mark the deal used which I did.\n\nAs I said before, this won't be a one time visit.  It is good, and I am a fan!!  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers for letting me know this place exists.",

The long lazy chaise lounges remind me of a giant cow's tongue. They are an amazing place to spread out after dinner & continue the conversation.  In fact, you can even eat there if you'd like.\n\nThat brings me to the food. The food is good & reasonably priced. The portions generous & easy to share.

Wasn't completely empty, but the staff had already begun closing up shop for the night. We were seated immediately. The waiter pretty much told us that we needed to order within the next five minutes or else the kitchen wouldn't prepare our food for us. We were there 45 minutes before the closing time. \n\nTheir rolls menu is a bit confusing, because it has one side with the prices for about 50 different rolls, and on the back there is a description for only about half of them. We ordered four of the rolls that were described on the back. Ended up going with the Las Vegas roll, Shrimp Tempura roll, Caterpillar roll and Spicy Tuna roll and miso soup to start. \n\nThe miso soup was very below average. It had a fishy taste, which was awkward and didn't smell pleasant. On the upside, it was steamy hot. The rolls came out about 15 minutes later and to be honest, I was not impressed at all. \n\nThe Las Vegas roll was smothered in some sort of sweet orange colored sauce which was very unappetizing on top of a cream cheese, avocado, and smoked tuna deep-fried contraption. The spicy tuna roll was not cold- rather lukewarm- and was not spicy at all. The caterpillar roll was actually pretty decent, but had more avocado on top than was necessary and not enough fish inside. The tempura roll was the best out of all of them- which says a lot about the quality of their food. The tempura around the shrimp was a little soggy, and this roll was also lukewarm which was very unappetizing. \n\nThe service was pretty bland, nothing special. Prices weren't bad either. We split the bill and paid about $20 bucks each, which isn't terrible for 4 rolls, 2 soups and 2 drinks. \n\nOverall, I probably won't be back in the near future. \n\nPictures of the food are posted.",

Sadly, it all went to sh*t on the night of the dinner. First of all, they had two servers on a 50+ person party. Whaaa? I felt bad for the servers as they were completely set up to fail. Second, when one of my colleagues asked if some of our tables could get water, after waiting 45 minutes, the manager got in her face. Inappropriate! \n\nThe manager later apologized and our colleagues who had not yet been greeted or helped were quickly taken care of.

We've eaten here small handful of times and have had decent experiences.  First, Peruvian food in general is pretty heavy on meats, beware vegetarians.\n\nThe style of the food is pretty simple, some chicken/fish/meat, stewed in tomatoes (of sorts), and often over rice.  My experiences with the chicken have been moist and relatively flavorful, but pretty tame on the spice.\n\nThe flavors are interesting in the Pescado con salsa de camarones (fried fillet of tilapia-esque fish, with a tomato based shrimp sauce).  It was light and pleasant.\n\nEstofado de Pollo.  This is a chicken stewed in tomato sauce and Peruvian spices and served with steamed rice.  It was a pleasant, simple flavor, reminding me of home cooking.\n\nI have had the cevice a couple of times, sometimes limey and delicious, others it has been a bit \"off\".  \n\nOverall, the flavors are often subtle, good, and reminiscent of general purpose comfort foods.  the style is not hot, punch you in the face spicy like Thai and Indian cuisine, but hearty and soothing.  It's not my favorite style of food (I like my flavors a bit more bold), but good for a change every now and then.",

The drink itself was around $4, which I think is leaning on the more expensive side. The drink was smooth but still had bits of Red Azuki bean in it and the boba was decent, slightly chewy but soft and not flavored. The drink itself was a bit sweet for me, so I would suggest getting it less sweet.\n\nInterior is interesting with graffiti from guests along the wall, leaving it with a casual vibe similar to that of Angry Crab or Boiling Crab. The service was fast and there's plenty of seating for one to sit and have drinks with friends or family. I don't recall if there is Wi-Fi available. The Street doesn't have snacks, but do serve instant ramen with rice cakes (Korean) and Patbingsoo (Korean Shaved Ice) as an alternative dessert. \n\nDefinitely would love to try their shaved ice as I didn't find the boba here amazing.",

Well turns out they never made them (or got misplaced) and we had to wait another 5 or so minutes for them to be finished. Also they had no carbonation for their beverages, however they were nice enough to tell the customers before hand but that didn't leave really any drink options.

I left a comment in the comment card box re: the order mix ups and to my surprise the manager wrote me a personal email apologizing for the mix up and offering a gift certificate for my next visit.

Now imagine it happening in slow motion.  When the order is filled, they call your name to look in the box and if the order is right then they go back to put string on the boxes using the string machine (maybe the fastest thing in the place) After the string is put on the boxes, they bag it up.  AND THEN you wait in another line to pay.  It really couldn't be any more inefficient.\n\nThe mini cannoli and the small apple turnover were good.  The cupcakes were decent.

It's just this place has been open for a while now, it's Saturday and you know you're gonna be swamped. You should have experienced, fast bartenders working. Not new people or people in training or if you do staff with other experienced staff. No one in our group was able to get a drink before our table was ready. And when we were helped finally the bartender seemed confused as to what we wanted and where to locate it in the bar. As we were texted our table was ready he proceeded to bring out 3 different beers to see if it was what the person in our group wanted. We just said forget about it because our table was ready. We also got a text for our table however there were also 2 other groups waiting for their tables as well, so not enough hosts and confusion as well.\n\nI really enjoyed my meatloaf, would get it again but probably should be served with a salad or veggies, maybe fried onions on top. The meatloaf was slightly mushy but I like it like that. The potatoes also a soft texture so something else would've helped, gravy was delicious. I had a bite of my mom's veggie burger option, a pistachio burger it was also very tasty. Their burgers were a nice 1/2 pound, but a little skimpy on the fries. We also got 2 pounds of mussels to share, they were OK but for almost $20 would probably skip next time. Server was OK pretty fast if not just a little awkward but better then the bar service.

        "text": "The food was great and the price was good.  The only few things we disliked here was that there is too much going on and our waiter didn't come once to see how things were, or we needed anything more (which we did), he came at the end of our meal to offer dessert and the check.   We were trying to get his attention but he was too strung out.  So this is what we didn't like, one who puts children near speakers? (children need to be placed away from the DJ and speakers)  The greeters need a little more training on that, a fail on management.  Another fail, from management is the singing of the Happy Birthday to guest. Great idea, but don't take the waiters / waitresses away from their tables.  Keep the help, the food runners, waiters & waitresses doing their job and create another job for other positions there that don't have that big of an impact to your operations.  Such as, your three overwhelming greeters, use two to sing and alternate them as needed. Use the manager walking around as the other singer and that singing DJ too.  Now, you have a team of singers who won't impact your operations as you did before.  The last thing that was just as annoying as everything else failing here was that darn cow .  Are we at the NFR? This is crazy, employees were even cringing when they had to hit it.  It was just too much.  Why at the restaurant? In the middle of the dinning room, what?\nGood food but the environment needs to be controlled.",

My server Tom was fluent in both Chinese and English so was able to give some great recommendations. He was the nicest server I've ever had; all smiles! The menu itself is a work of art. Laminated in frosted matte paper, includes pretty pictures, hardbound and in both English and Chinese. \n\nI ordered the Flaming rabbit and my hubs ordered the Sichuan lamb. The Sichuan heat is real, you guys. We used up probably 6 napkins between the two of us to mop up sweat and sniffles. But it is not just plain hot--the authentic \"mala\" flavor really comes out. The prices are high and the portions are medium sized, but the variety and taste made up for it. It's a good sized restaurant for its cramped Squirrel Hill location and some of the art pieces are really beautiful. I will definitely be back to try Mao's pork belly in taro and many other amazing-sounding/looking dishes. \n\nAlso, everyone else who was eating here was Chinese so I knew this joint was authentic. Usually, I am the only Asian person slurpin' my noodles at many a Thai, Chinese or Japanese restaurant.",

Last time we came was in April. We decided to stay local last night and we made an Open Table reservation at 7:00 on a Saturday. When we entered the restaurant, immediately noticed all the new configurations of more lounge areas, seeming getting rid of quit a few dining tables. We then noticed the different menu and the downsizing of menu items. Tiffany was not working. Our server Bobby took our cocktails orders: Vodka on the Rocks with extra Olives (house vodka) and a Cosmopolitan, not to sweet (house vodka), Fried Calamari, and the Empanadas. \n\nThe drinks were delivered the Vodka on the rocks was in a very small glass, my Cosmopolitan was weak: out of a mix, not shaken and made traditionally and was very sweet. I had to send it back to tell them to put more lime juice. When our food was delivered we noticed the Calamari portion was small, but a lot more greens, compared to the past times we've ordered it. It was the same with the Empanadas. We were not Happy diners at this point, so we requested the check.\n\nTHIS is the price gouging. The Wild Vine Uncorked charges $16 for a drink!!! Really when our past receipt form April was only $10. When we asked Bobby the server all he said was that's the HOUSE drink price, and when I asked what would of been the cost of the TOP Shelf he said about $19-$20. REALLY you are charging $16 for a house vodka... you should be ashamed!!! Get real people, this is Chandler AZ (not even downtown Chandler). The Wild Vine Uncorked is NOT Scottsdale Restaurant and frankly Scottsdale doesn't even charge that amount for a cocktail! \n\nNever again!",

I went with my man and two of his friends and this was enough Nachos for all of us--huge portions! It was so good and the jalape\u00f1os were super fresh! Definitely a good balance of flavor with the smokiness of pulled pork...I think this is one of the best things to get at HQ.\n\nI ordered 10 piece boneless wings for my main course. I got half Parmesan garlic and half honey hot. I kind of wish I got ALL honey hot because that flavor is phenomenal! It blew me away--my favorite combo on chicken is honey and hot sauce and this delivered the simple yet amazing flavor. The Parmesan Garlic? Not too great. Too creamy and gets cold super fast, drizzled on top. It reminded me of Alfredo sauce. \n\nMy man got the all beef sliders and he said they were pretty good. My friends also got sushi, the P83 roll which was good from what they said; the Out of Control Roll was not out of control At all. It was actually very basic. \n\nWe ended off with dessert. We wanted fried churros but were told they no longer have them. SO SAD! I love churros. We got fried Oreos instead which were BOMB just like carnival ones! And mini donuts stuffed with Nutella. Super good! \n\nDefinitely will be back again!",

It has a sports bar atmosphere, so now we can watch all the games while enjoying our Korean fried chicken (woot). \n\nWe were seated right away after arriving, so thankfully there wasn't a wait for the table at least. We decided on the bulgolgi sliders, salmon salad, and the mixed half and half (soy sauce and spicy) fried chicken. The sliders and salad came out at a reasonable time, but wow did we have to wait a while for the chicken. It was at least half an hour after we got sliders and salad that we finally got the chicken. Our server at least stopped by to apologize for the wait, saying \"I'm sorry for the wait, but the chef mixed up your chicken order.\" If there are only two flavors for the fried chicken, how do you mix up the order?! \n\nAs for the fried chicken itself, we were quite pleased when it finally came out. Piping hot, the skin was crispy, and wow did the spicy flavor have a nice kick to it. On a cold fall day, one can't help but smile when she has spicy Korean fried chicken in front of her. The soy sauce chicken was a nice balance in between, so I could still feel my lips and wasn't burning too badly from the spicy flavored chicken. The radish(daikon) unfortunately wasn't so fresh, which was disappointing since one always needs the cooling crunch of the radish while enjoying Korean fried chicken. Overall we were happy with the food, but wait time for the food itself is still an issue. I probably would come back to have some more chicken, but only if there was nothing else scheduled that day.",

We went there  on a  saturday (when it was mid 60s outside) so naturally the Strip was packed. We sat at the bar and the bartender quickly got our draft selections. They had a very good draft list by the way. Since it was lunch time the choices were not plentiful but we both ordered a cup of lobster bisque and my boyfriend ordered the cajun catfish bites. The catfish bites came out first. They were \"eh\" could have taken them or left them. Our soup was forgotten about. After we asked the bartender who did not take our order, we got the soup right away. The soup, now, was very good-it had plenty of lobster in it for the size of the cup and was very flavorful. The guys next to us at the bar ordered a large oyster platter which did look very good so I'd like to go back and try that. Now, our bill was $35. That was not the issue. The issue was that we asked to have it split in half and when we got our credit cards back each one had been run through for $26. Now $26+$26 is way more than $35. So I have no idea how he split it in half. When we pointed this out, he said \"I screwed that up huh?\", apologized, and corrected it. That bartender had great energy and you could tell he enjoyed what he was doing (or could at least act like it).I'd like to go back and try something else as their soup was promising but the catfish bites missed the mark.",

I don't know if the restaurant mis-executed but our steaks were generally over-cooked.  My steak in particular was very over-cooked.\n\nBone-In Rib-Eye, Illinois aged 21 days 20 OZ ($64) - below average, 2.5/5 -  They over-cooked my steak. I ordered medium-rare and the steak came out medium to borderline well.  The insides were dry and it was not tender.  The exterior seared portions were charcoal-black and very crunchy.  Again, I don't know if they mis-executed my order but I was pretty disappointed w/ my steak.  This is also a small nitpick - I also prefer the steak came out hotter; I know you are supposed to let steaks sit for 5 minutes before serving but my steak was very slightly colder than I enjoy.\n\n\"White-corn\" Salad (Special) $20 - average 3/5. The salad \"leaves\" are replaced w/ corn (so it's like you are eating a bowl of corn).  Topped w/ baby tomatoes, goat cheese, and a type of mayonnaise-cream mixed w/ the corn.  It tasted okay.  I think they used too much mayonnaise/cream 'cause it tasted too creamy.  \n\n-The sides are served family style so we ordered a few items; Potato Tarte Tatin $19 (Pretty good), Mac & Cheese $12 (excellent), Yukon Gold Potato $12 (average), Tempura Onion Rings $12 (Below average). As such, I'd recommend the Potato Tarte Tatin & the Mac & Cheese.  Everything else was average.\n\n-Free parmesan bread sticks.  Also taste average but presentation is beautiful.\n-Free cheese-puffs bread.  Taste average but beautiful presentation.\n-Free-  4 types of bread (cheesy bread, pretzel, wheat and another I can't remember) .  Most of them are standard/average, but again, presentation is beautiful.  The pretzel was pretty good tho.\n-The steaks also come w/ 4 types of dipping sauces (mustard, hollandaise, French mustard, and another I can't recall).  I typically don't use dipping sauces w/ my steaks but it's an option if you fancy.\n\nService is great, 5/5.  Ambiance is very modern & nice.\n\nTIPS:\n-Corkage $50",

I had such a bad experience back in April 2011 when this location opened that I didn't go back for awhile. 14 months later I finally decided to give them another try and place a carry out order. \n\nThe person who took my order over the phone was nice and helpful. Apparently there is a special website: famousdaveslv.com that has the local menu on it which differs somewhat from the national menu. After taking a look at it we settled on mac & cheese from the kids menu with a side of spiced apples, Texas Beef Brisket with spicy mac & cheese and cole slaw, and a BBQ Chicken Sandwich with a side of Wilbur Beans. $29 got us three little black plastic boxes and a styrofoam cup of milk for the kids meal. \n\nSo when we get it home we open the bag up and we're looking at $30 worth of food and we're like where's it at? Appearances / non-standard portion sizes aside, it didn't taste much better and all the Rich & Sassy sauce you can smother it with didn't help. The brisket was over cooked and tasted like double corrugated cardboard. The spicy apples looked like someone dumped a big spoonful of spice on top and it looked bad and tasted like crap. The BBQ chicken? Awful! Bleech! Boring, flat, I thought this was BBQ? It sure doesn't taste like any BBQ I know! And being from Kansas City, one of the 4 established American capitals of BBQ I know BBQ. \n\nI could go on and on but the fact is the dog ate well last night with half the brisket going to him, my 2 year old ended up spitting out the mac and cheese and the apples, and pretty much everything else ended up being put in a nice 30 gal plastic trash bag for Republic Services to take it where it belongs. The landfill. It was so bad I found myself thinking Sysco's horrible \"BBQ\" meat - just add their special food service sauce\" would have tasted better than this slop. \n\nI promised my wife that for as long as we live in Vegas, I will never ask her to have Famous Dave's again. Ugh, why did I torture my family by thinking this would be any good? They deserve better, and so do you. Don't go here.\n\nEdit: After finishing writing this review I looked over at the dog bowl and the brisket is still there. He even moved it out of the way to get to the dog food under it. Seeing that I created a new list: Even the Dog won't eat it. And my dog likes almost everything so this is kinda weird when he won't touch it.",

If this comment offends you, feel free to pull down your pants and start crying now. \n\nAfter looking over what I would consider the 'Cliffs Notes' version of a wine list (BS on calling yourself a wine cellar), we chose a bottle of the ONEHOPE Red Cab. I was happy to learn that half the proceeds went to the cure for Autism until i realized that the waitstaff could have used the money, as they all had some special needs of their own. \n\nIn an attempt to move past the mediocre start to the evening we moved on to the food menu.  \n\nThe Tomato/Basil/Mozzarella bruschetta had no basil (wtf?), the Orzo and Shrimp starter lacked the red onion it so desperately needed to be a success and who in their right mind serves their pizza on oversized crackers? Just because you throw something 'fancy' on the menu like duck confit doesn't mean you have a license to lack on quality. \n\nThankfully the music became the highlight of the evening. If it weren't for the 2-man, live band playing a lively rendition of MyGirl in the corner, I don't know if we would have survived the evening ;)",

Both times I have been here (we went back within a week) the hash browns are better than most diners as they not only put onions in there, but they caramelize them so they have a slight burnt taste to them...very yummy! The eggs are also plentiful and I don't believe they charge extra for egg whites, a huge plus!\n\nI only have 2 very minor complaints: 1. They have really good coffee that isn't bitter or too acidic, but they almost ruin it with those little International Delight coffee creamers (vanilla, hazelnut and half and half)...would like to see real half and half served. 2. The butter on toast has an interesting appearance to it. While it taste good, it has the color and texture of non-fat butter as it doesn't really melt, it kind of just sits there, on the bread.\n\nBut other than that, glad we found this place and will definitely be one of our regular go-to breakfast spots in the East Valley.",

We have driven by on many evenings to see the patio full and alive.  We were in need of an early dinner on a Friday night so we stopped by to give it a try.  \n\nParking was relatively easy since it was early, but be warned, the lot fills up. The restaurant was incredibly clean and I love the decor.  There is a descent size curved bar off to the left when you walk in that looks like it fills up easily. Good sized patios and sun shades for the interior dining room.  If you visit around sunset, be prepared for that sun to sneak in even if the shades are drawn.\n\nOur server was super bubbly and attentive. When my girlfriend and I try new places, she will usually ask what the best or most popular item on the menu is. Our server hadn't been working there long so she was happy to grab one of the others who has been working for the restaurant for 7 years. He answered all of our questions and made some recommendations. \n\nI had the pollo con queso and my dinner date ordered the yucutan with the machaca. Apparently hers was better than mine,  I didn't try it but I was happy with mine.  Both came deep fried, mine covered in a jalape\u00f1o cream cheese and she had the same on the side.  Rice and beans were both excellent.\n\nI ordered a glass of wine that I didn't care for and our server took it back and replaced it with the sangria.  I honestly didn't care for that much either...I must not have been in a drinking mood since I never send anything back, let alone alcohol.  She did a great job of expressing that they just want their guests to be happy with everything.\n\nWe will definitely be returning. There are some other good looking items on the menu (some sort of Mexican tortilla stack thing...looks amazing. The woman next to us ordered it.) and hopefully I'll leave room for the fried ice cream.",

        "text": "This Ruth's Chris Steakhouse is the busiest of all of their many locations (if I heard it explained correctly).  It is located inside Harrah's casino, and has a beautiful view (especially in the evening) of the Las Vegas Blvd and The Forum Shop across the street from the bar and most of the dining area.\n\nTo get to the restaurant look for the pair of elevators with the Ruth's Chris Steakhouse signage nearby. If you can't locate it,I am sure one of the Harrah's staff will be happy to provide direction or perhaps even escort you there.\n\n(Disclaimer)  I was at this Ruth's Chris Steakhouse recently for a private function, therefore I will primarily limit my comments on the service, food, and overall dining experience.\n\nFirst, the decor and overall ambiance was very pleasant.  The lighting is dim, not conducive to food photography (unless you have really good camera gears that are capable of low light photography), as you don't want to disturb other guests with your flash photography.  But the view of the Strip and automobiles and pedestrians below is almost hypnotic.  (4.5/5)\n\nThe staff that waited on us were a good group.  Rene our server was exceptional, and was knowledgeable about the menu, including details not printed on the menu, as well as the trivia about the oven temperature for preparing steaks (1,800 degrees) and warming the plates that the steaks and most other entrees are served on (500 degrees for the plate, so don't get burn).  (5/5)\n\nHighlights of their menu:\n\nCowboy (USDA Prime Beef Bone-In) Ribeye.  If you love a good steak cooked to your desired doneness, they have excellent steaks.  Portion size is 22 oz, including the bone.\n\nCaesar Salad:  Very common in most restaurants, but they prepared a really good one here.  (4.5/5)\n\nSeafood Gumbo.   A milder version of the gumbo that will suit the palette of most guests. I personally like my seafood gumbo with more kick, at least from the Andouille sausage and seasoning.  (3.5/5)\n\nBarbecued Shrimp.  Used barbecue spices in the sauce (which is very delicious and would go great with the breads from the bread basket), but the Jumbo Gulf shrimp is sauteed not grilled.  (4.5/5)\n\nSweet Potato Casserole.  Of the sides we ordered (French Fries, would be better if it was double fried or more crispy; Creamed Spinach, no complaints; Potatoes Au Gratin, no complaints), the Sweet Potato Casserole was the only one we completely finished.  It is sweet, has a nice crunchy crust, and I liked it with my entree, but could also enjoy it as a substitute of their normal dessert options.  (5/5)\n\nBanana Cream Pie.  Generous portion, easily shared with 2-4 dining companions, if you even have room to spare after a steak dinner.  \n\nOverall, everyone at the table was extremely happy with the service, food and had a blast.  5 stars!",

Outdoor seating is available on nice days. They have a full bar when you enter. You can either sit at tables near the front or in the upper berth in the back. \n\nMy waiter went over the specials for today and I learned that today's main special was Mahi-Mahi with wild rice, mushrooms and asparagus. I was pleased with the presentation and the food was indeed very good. I was told that mussels is what they specialize in but that isn't what I'm into. Expect to pay close to $20.00 for entrees. You can order sandwiches for less or you can do a grilled cheese half sandwich and soup pairing as well. They also have different salads on the lunch menu. Regardless I'm sure I would be pleased with most of their offerings.\n\nService is friendly and attentive to my needs. Free street parking is available although it is very difficult to find. The cafe is located at the corner of Reynolds and Hastings St in Point Breeze  but the entry faces Hastings St. You are close to Mellon Park.\n\nAs I said it is best to get there when they open because this place does fill up fast.

They also sell bryer's ice cream and do shakes and floats as well.\n\nTheir plates are a nice size, moderately priced, and most importantly, very tasty.  I usually get a plate with 1/2 chicken kabob, 1/2 gyros with fries, salad, and rice for $10.50 or so.  My coworkers always get the gyros sandwich with fries and a drink for about $8.  The two brothers who own this place are real nice guys and care about their customers.  I highly recommend this place.",

A nice beer selection on tap including Angry Orchard, Purple Haze and Greenman. It's good to see a small local joint that mixes up their taps and doesn't just have the standard Bud and Miller on draught. Good number of bottles as well so easy to find a favorite. \n\nThe place is a very laid back feel and the doorman who checks IDs (never a cover charge) has always been incredibly nice. Steven is usually behind the bar slinging drinks which is a very good thing. I've become a regular here and he's great at taking care of our group. \n\nThe rooftop is great to grab some air and is typically less crowded than the downstairs on Fridays and Saturdays. They have a rooftop bar but sometimes it's open and sometimes it's not. Cornhole on the roof and darts, foosball and shuffleboard downstairs for your entertainment. Seems they always have live tunes on Saturdays and occasionally on Fridays as well - never heard a bad band here and best part is the band is obviously loud but it doesn't overtake the entire bar - I can stand over by foosball and here what the person next to me is saying - feel like that's a rariety for a lot of bars!\n\nWarning though the bar gets beyond packed after 11 or midnight on the weekends - can make it hard to get another drink or your tab at that point so you may wanna double fist and pay as you go. And if that's not your scene, just duck out early. Parking can sometimes be a pain and you'll drive around for 10 minutes looking for a space but just know that the Gin Mill is definitely worth the effort.",

The second time I visited it was a Saturday evening and my friends and I had to sit on the patio, which we were perfectly fine with, until the waitress came up.  She watched us sit down and gave us no time to look at the options before trying to take our order.  I had been there before so I knew what I wanted, my friend hadn't and wanted a minute to look over the whiskey selection.  She refused to take my drink order because \"she wanted to put them in together\" and then walked away.  She then came back less than 30 seconds later to ask if my friend was ready, he wasn't, and then walked away again before I could insist that I would please like my order put in.  Then we waited over five minutes and she was nowhere to be seen.  Nor did any of the other waitresses come anywhere near where we were to see if we had been taken care of. (I know they're all assigned tables, but to completely avoid going anywhere near that part of the patio was a bit much). When she finally deigned to come back over, we placed our order and got our drinks in fairly short order and then were completely ignored for the next hour.  No \"would you like anything else\" or \"how are you doing?\" nothing. When she finally did come over to \"see if we wanted anything\", she made it VERY clear we were inconvenient to her.  We decided to move on and she gave us our closed check that she magically already had at hand and refused to split it (had she bothered to give us a spare second when we placed our orders, we'd have asked her to split the bill then).\n\nWord of advice, go in an off hour, go early, whatever, just make sure you can sit inside.  If you're stuck on the patio, just move on.",

        "text": "So this wasn't my first trip to Bj's, but this was the most impressionable. It is close to my sister's house and makes for convenient dinners with the family. Last night was probably the worst experience we have had at BJ's so far and it left a bit of a sour taste in the mouth. \n\nFirst off, my husband ordered some pasta with lemon butter sauce, feta, chicken, olive oil, and some other stuff in it. He asked for no tomatoes or red peppers because he is a wuss like that. About 10 minutes after we finally ordered (and I mean finally) the waitress came out and informed him that the kitchen said his meal would be bland without the tomatoes and it would not be the same dish at all, then asked him if he wanted to order something else. After the award winning sales pitch he just received he said of course and asked for a menu. The waitress then disappeared, took another table's drink order, then made her way back with a menu. \n\nSecondly, our waitress was spacey, non existent, and never really checked up on us. Typically I would not be a stickler for something like that but one of the people in our party was given entirely the wrong meal. Somehow fettuccine Alfredo with blackened chicken turned into grilled chicken pasta with broccoli. The manager came and apologized but that was 15 minutes after the food runner went back into the kitchen to see about the order. Our waitress passed our table 4-5 times during this time and never once asked why a large plate of food sat untouched and every person in our table was turning to make eye contact. She never even apologized for the mix up later. \n\nThen they brought my niece's food was brought out about 20 minutes before our food. We were a little concerned when our food did not follow and then about 10 minutes later the waitress came to explain that she sent it out early since \"kids eat slow.\" In reality it just lead to my niece being finished with her food before the adults and had plenty of time to frolic in the left over mac and cheese. \n\nFinally, when the bills were brought out she boasted that she did not charge our table for our non alcoholic beverages (an ice tea and sprite) and acted as if she had done us a favor. I would of much rather preferred that I didn't have to flag her down to ask for a beer (which ended up being watered down) and management would of taken some sort of responsibility for the long wait (35-40 minutes for food- pasta and a burger), poor customer service, and total mess up on an order.",

My daughter needed pink ballet tights ASAP because hers were torn, she could only find one pair in her size (or so we thought), they were packaged in a torn DANSKIN cardboard sleeve surrounded by packaging tape, on the front was a little girl dressed in pink, I thought to myself, this will have to do because we need them for tomorrow. We got to the counter and I scanned them $7.00 BLACK SLIPPERS. Wait, what!? I read the back and it says \"not to be used as shoes\" *I tell the clerk, these are priced wrong, they're pink tights wrapped in packaging for black slippers. I kid you not, she SCANS THE PACKAGING and argues that the price is right. I told her the price is for BLACK SLIPPERS and she tells me that it says SLIPPERS because you \"slip tights on\"  I sent my daughter to get something else, we couldn't even tell if she would fit the tights because the tag had NO SIZE.  She had to settle for FOOTLESS tights,and guess what?  The packaging said FOOTLESS PINK Tights (they were $4.50), not BLACK SLIPPERS for $7.00. That woman was not about to tell me I was right. Watch how things are packaged people, you'll get ripped off and they don't care. Customer service is dead. I would've been fired for arguing with a customer when I worked as a cashier.",

I think \"We don't have decaf anything\" were his words.\nI can hear some \"purists\" saying that is not a problem because real coffee has caffeine, decaf is for wimps or is unnatural or whatever.  True as that might be, in my current situation I must restrict caffeine levels.  There might be other people out there who either share my situation, or have a situation of their own.  And dang it, some of us still love the taste of coffee!  Decaf coffee does not have to suck, and Counter Culture does make a decaf roast and a decaf espresso roast.  \nSo.  My rating stands until A) they start serving decaf or B) about oh, March or April of next year when it is safe for me to resume my old caffeine habits and I can come back and be wowed by their probably delicious coffee.",

Two years ago this was a rotation nightout spot for friends and I, so, I never had the chance to try out the place during early evening hours for food and drink. Fast forward to recently, seeing that Hi-Fi Kitchen across the street was ridic crowded compared to not as busy El Hefe, a friend and I decided to stop by for a drink and a snack. Upon entering we were told by one of the server/hostess girls to pick a table or sit at the bar. We both wanted to sit outside but saw all their high tops were taken and reluctantly sat at the bar. After a few mins, while waiting to order drinks, a table emptied out, and we snatched it up and this is where they get a one star. \n\nPersonally they do a good job as a bar in old town during the weekends, they play okayish dance music, it's loud, it's happening, it's relevant. They have the douches out to play and they keep the nighttime masses liquored up BUT that's it. Service wise they fail miserably. As we sat at our table, we waited, and waited, and waited so more. There was a server who went by us to attempt to clean up (attempt because she didn't do much) another vacated table, she passed us yet again to check on another table, and passed us yet again just walking by. She could clearly see that we were sitting there with two menus, looking at it, and now bored looking at our phones, and not ONCE did she take the courtesy to stop by and offer a drink order or water. NOTHING. Let me add, it's a bit disconcerting as a customer when you hear the bar staff express concern that Hi-Fi seems really busy across the street while they talk about their lack of business on their side. With servers that do not provide service I can see why you ought to be worried. \n\nI'm a patient person, and I give props to good service where due but our last straw occurred when a group of girls (six in all) showed up, walked in a grabbed a table behind us on the patio, and lo behold, the SAME SERVER, walks up and assists them, hands out menus, and turns around and ignores us yet again. WTF?!? We got up, we walked out. I saw the manager and felt the need to express my disgust at what I witnessed, maybe I didn't express myself clearly but he didn't seem to care much either.

I recently noticed the signs at the registers saying they will open a new register any time there are more than three people in the line waiting.\n\nThey keep a good amount of stock on the shelves and they are clean and organized as well.",

There was relatively fast turnover, but it's annoying having to cherry-pick someones table hoping they'll leave after their last bite. But, being a Saturday morning, being busy wasn't a deal breaker.\n\nWhen I received my omelette, the cheese was partially melted and rather tasteless. The eggs were rubbery like something you'd get at a cheap buffet. The potatoes were OK, but didn't compensate for the rest. Overall, the portion sizes were small and the food was just mediocre. I'm not a picky breakfast person, but I would rather go to Denny's or IHOP than come back to NCounter.\n\nIf you're looking for good breakfast in Tempe (near Mill), you're not far from Harlow's, Essence Bakery, Cafe Boa or even U.S. Egg.",

        "text": "Big disclaimer about this review.....\n\nI was finishing up my meal when I saw the waitress bring a bottle of red sauce and a bottle of green sauce to the condiment area.  Apparently, they have 4 bottles for the entire restaurant and a couple of customers decided to bring them to their table.  I didn't know that.  Chips/salsa are $2.49 and they charge for pico so I passed on both.  That being said, you're about to read a review for a Mexican food with no pico, no salsa, no red sauce, and no green sauce.  \n\nI ordered the \"Choose 3\" meal and got one asada, one carnitas, and one fish taco.  The meal option adds rice and beans.  All 3 were a bit dry (see above).  They just don't naturally come with a lot of wetness.  They have jalapenos and lime in the condiment area, but they are stored uncovered and they were dry as well.  The tacos were a little too bland for my taste, especially the fish taco.  The rice and beans are average.  The total was $7.12 but I did not get a drink.\n\nI'm a \"sauce whore\" at Mexican restaurants so you can take or leave my opinion on the food.  I'm used to having plenty to spread around and it's a bit of a turn-off to have to pay extra for it.\n\nOverall, the place is nice.  The service is friendly.  The food comes fast.  But it seems they need to choose whether they want to be a \"street taco\" kind of place or a regular Mexican restaurant.  If you order a 3-taco set, plus the chips/salsa, plus the pico, plus a drink, you're going to be close to $15 for your meal served on plastic plates.  For that price I'd probably go to more of a sit-down restaurant with a full menu.\n\nI'll give them another try when they have their \"taco Tuesday\" special where you can get them for $1 each.  And hopefully the sauce bottles will be available....",

I had the octopus because I had heard so much about it. Our waiter said he had the octopus and immediately started working there. After I tasted it, I asked him for a job application. Our friends had the crepes and the Benedict. I tasted the Benedict and thought it was terrific... My wife enjoyed her crepes. They have a bottomless Mimosa/Bellini on weekends that is a terrific deal. I'm going back for more octopus. We are so lucky to have this restaurant in Gilbert!\n\nBeware... went back again and my octopus looked like they were trying to fill up a plate with scraps. Disappointed with the octopus this time. The real problem was my wife had a hamburger and wound up sick in about 5 hours. Still sick 2 days later (recovering though) with what appears to be something from the burger. We won't be returning.

Knowing it's deep fried, I tend to shy away from these types of food, but I can never come to Island Flavor and not order this dish.  \n\nThe pulehu ribs has a dry rub versus the kalbi ribs more of a saucy seasoning are both salted heavy.  I always have to order my dish light on the sauce and the chef is more than happy to obliged.  I get an option to have brown rice instead of white rice, and then I replace my mac salad with saut\u00e9ed vegetables.  This place offers a good medium for me.

        "text": "There's a right way and a wrong way for businesses to do Restaurant Week in Charlotte. I think most Charlotteans that keep their finger on the pulse of the local restaurant scene know exactly what I'm talking about. Far too often I've given a place a chance only to find that their food isn't up to par, portions are scaled back way too much, or the business simply can't handle the influx of customers. The folks at Stoke should be the model that every other restaurant strives to be for Queen's Feast!\n\nReservations for 6:45, we arrive at 6:35 and are seated immediately. To my surprise, we are seated just steps away from the open kitchen. All night long we are able to watch Chef Chris Coleman plate some stellar looking food with such precision all the while making sure every dish was perfectly presented. Our waiter (also named Chris) was friendly and took the time to explain both menus being served that night and suggested some beers for us.\n\nThe food wasn't the only thing that was amazing looking. The entire restaurant is what I would call \"rustic-modern\" with a warm, spacious floor plan. I'm not sure which one steals the show more, the massive bar or the open kitchen! My first visit left me wanting to come back equally for the food and the atmosphere.\n\nOn to Dinner and my girlfriend and I chose three courses exclusively from the Restaurant Week menu. Another note on their menu for this event: They have a lot more options than most restaurants usually offer. 8 Appetizers, 6 Entrees, and 4 Desserts. Since me and Kristen split most of the plates, I'll list 'em all from first to last bite.\n\nMom's Deviled Eggs: These are perfect little bites of flavor explosion. Seasoning was spot on, not everything has to be overbearingly salty, spicy, or tangy, which is what you normally encounter with deviled eggs. Topped with butter pickles and aleppo chile, it was the perfect amount of sour and heat. While regular red chile is a one-hit wonder, aleppo dials the heat down a bit with subtle southwest hints of fruit and spice.\n\nF&S Hushpuppies: These have utterly destroyed hushpuppies for me. Never again will I be able to go to your average greasy spoon and order 'em, they won't stand a chance. Fried to perfection, which I would call a couple of seconds beyond golden brown, and served with simple honey and butter. The seasoning, the butter, the honey, it was just amazing. What really made it sing? Order a Birdsong Jalapeno Pale Ale and enjoy plate of these with it. You'll thank me later.\n\nBBQ Half Spring Chicken: This was my girlfriend's entree as the fettuccine & shrimp she was eyeing had pine nuts in it, and unfortunately she's allergic. Regardless, I saw no sign of regret as she rolled her sleeves up and devoured the chicken with her hands! I mean, really, there's no better way to mow down a bone-in bird. Again, a real simple dish but the execution on these simple ingredients are so carefully crafted they simply shine. Red grits were wholesome, thick, and delicious.\n\nSticky Pork Belly: When this plate first came out I was a little disappointed in the portion size. That soon changed when I realized how much flavor this piece of pork was packing. After the first bite I stared to cut my pork into tiny pieces just to savor it for a bit longer. The seared glaze on top gave the dish an amazing crunch with a hearty texture underneath in every bite. The squash and 'quick' pickles paired so well with this dish.\n\nBONUS Dish - Charred Octopus: So hats off to Chef Chris, he sent our table a small plate of the charred octopus. I got to admit, octopus is something I probably wouldn't have voluntarily ordered but I'm so glad I was able to try it here. The char gave the edges of the octopus this perfect crunchy texture and it almost reminded me of a more toothsome version of lobster. Paired with fingerling potatoes, spicy chorizo and aioli, it all came together to make one of the best small plates I've had in uptown.\n\n\"The Doughnut\" (Holes): I think this is the perfect way to enjoy a single serving of what is probably Stoke's most famous \"Instagram-worthy\" dish. I can't tell you what's better, the doughnut itself or the Diplomat Cream it's served with. Warm perfect texture with a crisp exterior, sweet and complex diplomat cream that has just the right amount of richness, and the Heath crumbles on top just nail all the criteria for a slam dunk dessert.\n\nChef Chris and his team are doing amazing things here. Now two visits in, I can honestly say I haven't had a single disappointing or even average dish. This dinner just had me blown away with the thoughtful combinations, every flavor worked so well with each other. Next time I'd probably request the kitchen to just surprise me, bring me what they like, it'd be a first! Thanks to everyone at Stoke for such an amazing evening. This was just one night ago and I'm already wanting to come back.\n\n'Nuff Said",

First, I did only try their tacos and only 3 kind, I can not review the whole restaurant, but I figure these are basic foods so if it is a good restaurant, they would get it right. Again I had the carne asada, carnitas, and marianted pork. They actually only use 1 thick tortilla soft shell instead of the two, made it a little drier, different texture, I have had these before and like before, I felt they were inferior to the two thin tortilla. The meat I could not taste because they were covered up in their sauce. I don't know if this was the norm, I definitely did not ask for it. Anyway, when you smother something with sauce, everything usually comes out tasting the same. So they all tasted similar and bleh. I gave it a two star instead of a one was for the service, very fast, food tasted like it too and two the prices were a little less than the other place. \n\nSo I think for now I will stick to Sorenos grill in Chandler because it seems like the best around the area. Phoenix is another quest, too far though, maybe some times later.",

I came back for another try and this time I had so many favorite dishes. the hash brown ham and biscuit was so good I had to get it twice. Another one of my favorite dishes was steak and eggs. They also had a variety of potato which enjoyed. Everything was warm and fresh. Our servers were very friendly like always and they were able to accommodate us with the baby stroller. They kept our table clean the whole time. As a whole the place is kept tip top clean even the floors looked shiny. Brunch and dinner are two whole different experiences. But both equally good. Although did enjoy this time brunch a bit more. The place was full and yet they still kept the food coming and everything neat and organized. The desserts area is like a rainbow. A wide variety of colors from fruit tarts to donuts, macaroons and even an interesting dessert I had for the first time called Vietnamese coffee, elegantly decorated with a gold chocolate coffee bean. To end this wonderful and flavorful experience I got an Oreo cupcake. Best oreo cupcake Ive tried. The frosting was delicious not too sweet just the right amount of sweetness to end my meal. I see myself coming to brunch here more often. Oh and I recommend you give the horchata a try it's very yummy something about it it's so refreshing and different than any other horchata Ive tried. Which explains why you see them refilling it constantly. I'm very pleased with this buffet and I must try for those that come visit.",

I think 7 checks in all. They seemed cool with it...at first. \n\nI have to preface by saying, the worst service I've ever received has been at the Cheesecake Factory. Out of the four times I've been, every single time has been horrendous. The very first time I went (this was a different location)  one of my dining partners didn't get their meal for 20 minutes after ours. We were completely through with our meals but the server never offered to comp her meal. In fact, he was never seen after taking our order. We had to flag down a manager to take care of the issue. \n\nThe other few times I've had the slowest, rudest service of my life. This time was no different. The server acted thoroughly annoyed by our group, was short with us, refused to smile AT ALL, and generally was a complete wench. Splitting the tab was clearly WAY too much work for her, as it took 20 minutes for her to figure out who ordered what (even though we asked if it was ok to split tabs long before we ordered) but actually running the tabs? Wow, add on another 10 minutes! We apologized again for having to split tabs, hoping maybe that would make her less huffy, but she never acknowledged that we were trying to be nice, and instead just went around acting huffy and like we were thorns in her side. \n\nWell, obviously she could be a total b*tch because gratuity was already included. 18% on the tab, which I understand with large groups. However, I felt she was acting as bitchy as she wanted to because in the end, she'd be getting a good tip regardless. \n\nAs for the food, it's a big whatever. Anything other than lunch is overpriced. In the end it's just overpriced ridiculously sized chain food . I don't understand why people love it so much. I hope for the rest of my life I never step foot in one again. I know I won't be missing much.",

I thought my lunch here was great, and my only wish is that they were closer to my job!\n\nI ordered the Angry Hotdog ($4.95), and the Angry Kimchi fries ($4.95).  The fries were actually sweet potato fries, covered in kimchi, an egg over easy, bulgogi, and Korean spices.  It had a small little bite to it that I actually would have preferred stronger.    The fries didn't come together so good for me.  I'm just not sure if the sweetness of the sweet potato goes with the spicy, meaty flavors of the bulgogi and Korean chili sauce.  They were good, but not great, and a little bit too greasy for me.  \n\nThe hotdog, however, was bomb!  I don't even know what all was on this thing because I couldn't waste time on trying to figure it out.  I just wanted to eat it!  The hotdog was indeed gourmet and nothing like a 7-11 hotdog.  The buns were fresh and tasty (I confirmed with the owner that they get their buns freshly baked).  The bulgogi on the burger gave it such a beautifully savory flavor.  A really solid hotdog, again with a Korean style spice that really brought all the flavors together.  Even though it was a decently sized hotdog, the thing only lasted about 30 seconds.  \n\nI am not a huge hotdog fan, but these are really unique.  The price is right as long as you don't get carried away with the toppings, which are $0.50 - $1.00 extra.  I look forward to trying more of their specialty dogs.  The service was nice, and the owner was very interested to find out what we liked and didn't like so much.  I think this hotdog shop is going to be a success.",

My fella really wasn't feeling them. I ordered a pork vermicelli bowl, while my fella ordered some beef pho. He also ordered a fried egg banh mi (can you say yum?), since he can't resist those when he sees them on a menu. I wasn't really feeling my vermicelli bowl (I took half to go and ended up tossing it later when I realized I didn't want any more), just didn't seem to have the right combination of seasonings and the noodles were a little mushy. The pho had a sweet flavor that I found incredibly unappealing and tasted a little like dirty water with sugar in it. My fella didn't like his pho at all and stuck to his banh mi. I tried it and the bread was fluffy and warm. Perfect texture and great portion for the price. He said he liked it, but would order it with fewer condiments next time.\n\nOverall, the experience left me unfulfilled. I desperately wanted to love the food since the owner and waitress were so nice and accommodating. If you come, just order banh mi and skip the rest.",

The poke bowl I got looked beautiful but was tasteless and old. The rice was dry and the salmon had no flavor. The way the bones were cut for the bone marrow made it so that there was barely any marrow left to scrape off. I loaded an entire plate with bone marrow and got enough for one crostini. \nCompared to other buffets in town there were more unique selections but the quality was mediocre. We had BOGO buffet passes which made it worth it, but if we paid full price I'd have been very disappointed. \nOverall: would recommend stopping by with a BOGO, but don't go if you're paying full price. There are plenty of great options at the Cosmo where your $50 will take you farther for an entree.",

There were a LOT of discrepancies between what we ordered online and what was relayed to LushBurger by Eat24; additionally the food sat for about 45 minutes before being delivered. Regrettably, as a consumer, my perception is reality and all I know is that I was delivered subpar burgers.  Jerry gave me a sincere apology which I appreciated greatly and I am looking forward to giving the restaurant another chance, sans Eat24.  Will update upon resolution.",

The first I got a bowl that tasted really weird, but they gave me a new bowl no charge so that turned out okay. The second time I asked about pieces of chocolate in a bowl that I noticed the last time I was there. The chocolate pieces weren't there before (or I probs didn't notice them) so I asked if they were vegan. There's dairy-free vegan chocolate, but not all chocolate is vegan so you just have to ask to check if it is. I had been told the bowl I had been ordering this whole time was vegan except for the honey, but then the woman at the counter said the chocolate pieces could have milk in them? Not sure if she double checked or if it actually does. And I was told up until then that for sure it was just the honey in the bowl that was not vegan. I didn't want to chance it so I asked if I could just replace the chocolate shavings with another topping. They wouldn't replace the chocolate shavings with another topping without charging extra. And I already order the bowl sans honey, no swapped ingredients for that either. I'm not sure why something as small as chocolate shaving was the last straw because I've paid extra for other things that were a bigger deal (like paying full price for a cheese pizza with no cheese), but I've been pretty tired of feeling gipped because I have to remove toppings/ingredients to make a dish vegan and then I still pay full price (or sometimes extra, in this case they charged extra to replace the ingredient but sometimes they want me to pay extra to just take out an ingredient). The bowls are made fresh so it's not like there's premade mix and they would have to go out of the way to swap ingredients. The nice thing is I don't have to do this anymore because so many already marked vegan options or all vegan restaurants are popping up. I ended up not ordering anything and leaving. So even though I've been coming here for over 4 years now, going to have to say bye to Genuine Fresche, after these two experiences just don't want to come here anymore.",

I know, I know, how bougie of me.. but every  AMC I've been to recently have made the upgrade. Plus, I live by a Harkins that does, so it doesn't make sense to drive extra miles to be more uncomfortable.\n\n2. The service is god awful! It took 10 minutes and my boyfriend leaving the theatre to track someone down before we were served.  Every employee we interacted with seemed so upset they had to be there.  Every time we asked a question, we were met with cold stares and exasperation.\n\n3. Whereeeee is my freshly popped pop corn and root beer?  Ughhhhhh.  We all know half the movie-going experience is being able to binge eat your favorite movie theatre snacks.  The popcorn was so stale, we barely ate any, and they didn't have half the soft drinks on the menu.  What kind of theatre is this?\n\nOk, I originally gave this place two stars but I'm downgrading to 1.  Really no positives about this place.  Oh, and parking was $8.  Seriously, just don't come here.  Choose another theater.",

Over the years, I noticed that the portion of the entire Chili Mac shrunk half its size, and what's worse, I now think that even the quality of the the noodles have changed...for the worse! What was once thicker noodles, they've now gotten thinner. \n\nThank God the flavor of the Chili Mac remained amazing as always, but I think the noodles have been downgraded...both in quantity and quality. Beyond disappointing...almost shocking! I NEVER thought that the quantity and the quality of their Chili Mac would ever change...but sadly, I feel that it had.\n\nI also noticed that the Iced Tea was watered down...and tasted more like water than tea!\n\nAs always, the musical overhead was a random mix of 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's...just not sure what to think of their overhead tonight.\n\nOne thing that's been fairly consistent is their friendly service. Well, actually, in retrospect, we did have to flag down a random waitress tonight for an Iced Tea refill and an order of Kuchen, their incredible Peach Cobbler (still great as ever!).\n\nOverall, it was a disappointing night. I still love Lupie's (for their amazing Chili Mac...and well, just because it's grown to become a family tradition!), but I'm seeing some sad changes. At this rate, I may no longer want to keep returning...which is quite shocking, given that this has been a staple restaurant of mine for decades (been coming here since I was in my 20's!!). :(",

Don't argue, just go with it...The pizza is better. The salad is fresher. The chicken is juicier. They have sushi, Chinese, Mexican, American, etc etc etc. You name it, they probably have it. What I appreciate is that on Seafood night they have big, juicy crab legs. A good 5-6 plates of those and I'm good to go. Prices have gone up on the Seafood buffet recently to $39, which is a bit steep IMO, but know that you're getting great quality food for the extra $10-15 you would normally pay. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention to spectacular dessert section of the buffet. Awesome isn't a strong enough word to express my love for it. Everything is made fresh - I even got warm chocolate chip cookies. Ice Cream is delicious. The little candies they offer are really good as well. \n\nDon't forget the unlimited beer & wine - so if you plan on drinking like a champ, you might as well eat like one too. \n\nGamble a little and enjoy the 2 for 1 offers they send.",

Our server, was Nick--a consummate professional, but the manager, Sean, checked in with us and other surrounding tables several times as well.  We were provided water immediately, our wine orders were taken and fulfilled promptly, and we started with the herbed ricotta with tomato jam.  That appeared within 10 minutes, and oh my, was it delicious.  The ricotta was a wonderfully, silky texture with just a hint of herbs, and combined with the smoky flavor of the tomato jam---yum!  The crostini was perfect too---not too crusty or brown, just a bit of chew.  Only comment---we could have used one more piece of crostini, the serving of cheese and jam was so generous.  We ended up scooping the last mouthful of the appetizer up with our knives---we couldn't let it go to waste!  \n\nFor entrees, I ordered the fish and chips and DH ordered the small plate of brisket with baked beans and sweet potato fries.  Small---hah!  DH couldn't finish it all and brought home a doggie bag.  He declared the baked beans \"off the chart good\", and they WERE delicious.  Like other reviewers commented, the brisket was of excellent quality and flavorful, but somewhat dry.  (Because it was \"Texas-style\"?)  DH asked for a side of BBQ sauce, which he said was tangy and sweet and quite good.  The sweet potato fries were...sweet potato fries.\n\nMy fish and chips had the most delicious, perfect, crispy coating---but it was WAY too salty for me.  Sadly, I ended up peeling most of that delicious batter off the perfectly cooked fish.  I don't know if the salt was in the batter, it had been over-salted after frying, or---as is very possible---I am just just over-sensitive to salt.  No other reviewer commented on the fish and chips being salty.  But the fish itself was excellent, and so hot when placed before me, I had to wait a minute or so before digging in.  The housemade tartar sauce was really good.  Again, the chips (fries) were just chips.\n\nWe didn't have room for dessert.  All in all, we were very pleased by the service, the ambiance, and our meals and we look forward to Liberty Station becoming a regular on our restaurant rotation.",

The Habit fits the bill...in every way possible. \nI came here on a Friday night (tonight to be truthful) Witt my mom and sister. Despite it being dinner time and Friday, it was surprisingly not too crowded. Even if it was super busy, it has plenty of seating - both booths and tables - so it's safe to say you'll find a seat regardless of how many people are there. \nThe three of us got the #1 Charburger Original Combo. Cheeseburger, fries and a drink. Two of us got regular fries and one got sweet potato fries. The burger was outstanding. Really, really outstanding. And this is coming from me, a self proclaimed burger snob. It was cooked perfectly and the pattie was a substantial size, no \"where's the beef\" here, that's for sure. It was on a fresh bun and came with mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickles and caramelized onions. Everything went so well together, the  ratio of meat and cheese to garnishes was on point. I swear I tasted everything on the burger in every single bite. The fries were great-fresh and hot, crispy on the outside with soft potato on the inside. The sweet potato fries were the same-really good and a nice break from traditional fries. The drink offerings are your typical fountain drinks but they do have 3 flavors of tea in addition to carbonated soda. There's also a cool serve yourself bar with banana peppers, jalape\u00f1os and regular peppers-a nice touch for sure. \nThe staff there was very friendly and helpful. The young lady taking out order was great at answering the couple of questions that we had (this being our first time there) and she smartly recommended the sweet potato fries. Another employee came by our table to check on us and see if we needed anything-not service that you typically get at a fast food joint but certainly appreciated! \nWith all the burger options in town, I find it hard to decide which is my favorite but this one is definitely in my top 5! \nI could see The Habit becoming a real habit for me!",

My hopes rise and I start thinking that AZ Republic scored on it's review.\n\nWe order.  Service is friendly, coffee was a little weak, but Ross loves the OJ.  Then the food arrives. \n \nThe presentation is impressive.  My omelet was TALL!  FLUFFY!  Both Ross and I were wowed!  Then I cut into it and it was runny, soggy, and tepid (not really warm).  The waitress came by, asked how everything was (and she seemed to really mean it versus the polite ask but they don't really care to know the answer question that usually comes from waiters).  I told her about the omelet and she offered for them to recook it.  \n\nShe came back with my same omelet that must have been thrown in the microwave.  The top was steaming but interior now warmer - but not yet warm.   I picked around the soggy parts and ate the top (that was Ross' suggestion).\n\nThe waitress came back again, concerned that I wasn't eating enough.  She was so sweet.  I didn't want to make her feel badly.  But she sent the manager over -- which I thought was very proactive customer service.\n\nThe manager (maybe the owner?), stopped by and asked me what I thought might be wrong and offered up that it might be the egg beaters.  She did not offer me something else (but did suggest the next time I go in I should try the Pecan Cinnamon Roll).  And, when we got our bill, the omelet was still on it (they didn't comp my meal).\n\nWe paid and no complaint.  I don't expect to be comped, I just thought the experience with the manager was interesting.",

So 2 so so sandwich and a side order of soggy fries and burger king tasting onion rings and a soda for $30 something bucks I will have to say I wished I'd spent that somewhere else.

Lunch meats seemed prepackaged and pretty much flavorless. \n\nUghhh the garlic parmesan wings didn't looked seasoned at all and tasted like they had been deep fried sans garlic and parmesan.

What happened to this place?\n\nWe hadn't been here for a while (since JJanga opened) so we decided to give it a go... \n\nThe following things caused my dinner to be a 1 star experience:\n\n-HOT restaurant... I think the AC might be broken so they had floor fans throughout the restaurant but that didn't really help. It was quite stuffy. \n-SLOW service... The servers were so slow and the food from the kitchen came out at a snail pace. Miso soups and salads were ordered at the beginning of the meal and didn't come out till mid way through. Plus we had to flag down the servers for water refills.  \n-RUDE sushi chef... We usually love sitting at the bar but our sushi chef, Denis, was not friendly and never acknowledged us. He never answered when we would place an order... He either really didn't want to be there or he can't speak EngRish? \n-QUALITY went downhill... The fish was average at best. They were out of uni, quail egg and yuzu sorbet. The sweet shrimp smelled fishy and nothing was amazing. \n\nThe only positive of the meal was our awesome busser, Ariel. Thank God there is someone who works there that actually wants to be there. The worst part of the meal was the fact that we felt like we were asking a favor every time we placed a sushi order... WTF?!! No thanks.",

The \"jazzfries\" were ok, just mostly smothered in this really decadent sauce- it was a little much for me and again too salty. The wait was a little long, but that's to be expected from a food truck. Bottom line is that I would try other things from the menu if I happen to be around the truck again, however I wouldn't drive out of my way to track down the truck.",

        "text": "An overall regrettable dining experience. The hostess was unapproachable or dare I say, \"bitchy.\" Also, we had no server once we were seated - a random server came up to us to let us know, explicitly, that he wasn't our server but he will take our drink orders. As we were ready to order, we also had to place our order with our not-so-server, but we kept having to flag him down to ask questions about the menu. I was irritated since we didn't receive a proper introduction, recommendation or detailed explanation of the menu.\n\nUnfortunately, we were seated in a booth that shares the same corner as the staff's registers - what an awkward set-up. While we waited for our dinner we heard, loud and clear, server conversations; bickering and critiquing each-other. We also couldn't avoid hearing an earful of servers singing, obnoxiously. It's not a comfortable ambiance for us to relax in each others presence, or even enjoy private conversation.\n\nThe food was laughable. There was only one dish that we could honestly recommend and it was $13 ghost pepper chicken wings. That's it? The menu seems very confused and I'm sure the chef is just as confused.\n\nLet's go through the items we tried:\n\nGhost pepper wings ghost chili BBQ and green ranch chili sauce $13 -Shockingly, this was the only item of the evening that we actually enjoyed. I loved the perfect balance of sweetness and the spicy heat offered in the ghost chili BBQ sauce. The ranch consistency was watery, but the flavor was unique and delicious. The wings were cooked properly and had a decent amount of moist meat. But seriously. Wings are wings, you aren't really missing anything here. Flavor rating: 4/5\n\nSticky belly steamed buns $9 - Total white-boy style (in a bad way) we weren't a fan of the dry, hard bao bun, tough, overcooked thick cut bacon & weird tangy salad dressing sauce. Also, the cabbage slaw looked wilted and brown. I've had my share of tasty baos in Vegas (try: Bachi Burger, Gordon Ramsey BurGR, Fat Choy) and this sits at the very bottom of the list. This dish needs major work. Blegh. Flavor rating: 2/5\n\nLow country shrimp and grits $10 -  A serious disappointment. The \"crispy pork belly\" was a prank that was written on the menu description. It's actually tiny bits of chopped (hard) bacon. The fishy, tiny, frozen shrimp was offensively over-salted and lacking substantial cajun flavor. The grits were dry and bland and tasted like oatmeal, plus the cheddar cheese was sparse. All amateur mistakes. Flavor rating: 2/5\n\nSweet potato fries with Caribbean ketchup $4 - They arrived at our table room temperature and stale; we sent them back for a re-do. I was offended that we couldn't even get freshly fried sweet potatoes and that they offered us unwelcome fries from a heat lamp. The fries were standard, the ketchup was unique - but it's still nothing to write home about. You may want to go the extra mile and request some of the green chili ranch to pair with these fries - they work well together. Flavor rating: 2/5\n\nAfter a disenchanting dinner, we were ready to leave our experience far behind us. This place is not for us and probably not for you either if you appreciate your taste buds.",

Now, I must resort to someplace else. \n\nOn our last visit, I decided to just get a chicken tostada because my usual chicken salad would have been too much food. Plus I wanted the crunchy tostada shell. So here's where it gets bad. I order the shredded chicken on the side because I didn't want the juices making my tostada shell soggy. As the girl proceeded to put the chicken in a separate cup, she made a comment about how she hates when people get the meat on the side. The guy next to her then made a comment about how he agreed. Um, I'M STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU IDIOTS,  I CAN HEAR YOU!!! Then as the guy puts the lettuce on my food, he doesn't let the water drip from the lettuce. So all this water ends up making my tortilla shell soggy. Just what I didn't want. Then to top it off, as I'm eating my food, the chicken is way overcooked and super mushy. And there's a puddle of water at the bottom of my plate. See picture. \n\nI've noticed over my last few visits to this location that the employees don't seem to give a crap about the food they serve. They're just there for a paycheck. No care or quality. I love their food, especially the tortillas. But now, I might have to drive to a further location if I want my fix.",

What's that about management?\n\nThen my friend and I decided to go check out another venue and wanted a stamp for re-entry. So to leave there is a small exit/entrance to the right of the line coming in. A guy was there checking people and me and my friend stood to the side as he was busy and we didn't want to block the path. As soon as he finished he didn't give me or my friend a chance to say anything. He yelled at us immediately, abruptly and loudly \"you can't block the entrance you need to move\". I kindly responded that we just wanted to get a stamp so we could come back in. He then rudely pointed that we needed to go to a different area for that. Okay, fine. But they normally have done it as you exit. So I had no idea last night was different. Literally don't understand why it's so hard to be cool and be nice. It's a customer service position.

He offered my little boy a sample of yogurt, which surprised my kid. So he was so happy trying the flavors that we grabbed a cup with mangos, brownie chocolate, then my kid began to add gummy bears, cookies, sprinkles, but the reason we went inside and stayed was the excellent customer service of the friendly man behind the counter. There was the toy store next door, a restaurant named after the poet William Shakespeare, and a Hooters across the parking lot, but I would say that for children the stop is worth the flavor, especially if you have time to step into the Star Wars lego world of comic book adventure next door, which had tourists visiting from Texas when we went inside over the weekend.

Between our first and second drinks we waited about 15 minutes before she approached us and asked if we wanted to order another drink. Our glasses had long been empty. I'm sure our waitress was just distracted by this group next to our table that kept interrupting us when we'd order, pull our waitress away for their continual drink orders, and all around make some really rude/very inappropriate comments in general.

Anyone with common sense would serve it with a side of sauce or at least more than the tiny squirt they give you.  Ordered the $18.00 taco plate each taco graciously stuffed with a full tablespoon of meat- what a joke.  Our food was cold and nats where constantly landing in our salsa bowls.  The server Sandra did an excellent job and you can tell she truly believes in the food unfortunately it's overpriced for the portions and lacking flavor and temperature.  There are many other Mexican food places I would visit prior to a return here.  Service and atmosphere are excellent minus the bugs food is C-.  The  couple sitting next to us ordered a sandwich to share the each took one bite  commented on how bad it was and left.  The Carne Asada Tacos had decent flavor and had its moments but nearly every bite was interrupted by a hard piece of chewy fat or something nasty.",

I had to minus a star for the carne asada because the majority of pieces were too chewy to consume and some slices had fat on the ends. So with that meat eliminated, I moved on to the chicken, which came in a red version and was the highlight of this joint. The two-piece all-white was one breast and one tiny wing, but I thought i was getting two breasts. I could have used that extra big piece of chicken too because my last of the giant three tortillas had nothing to put into it after the tasty first piece didn't last long. Best side dish was probably the marinated onions and the forementioned tortillas. Crispy skin on the chicken also, so I will return for more pollo por favor.",

SWMBO had a margarita and was truly satisfied.\n\nWe started with a build your own guac that had some bacon and blue cheese and a few other items.  Really good, the blue cheese worked well with the sweet guac and the bacon!  Really good chips too!    \nWe spit our taco orders since you get 2 tacos. The Mushroom with garlic aioli and truffle salsa with brussel sprouts was the better of the two and very good.  The Korean with wagyu short rib, peanuts, napa cabbage and cilantro was OK.  The cilantro and seasoning gave it a nice flavor and a little heat but some of the short rib was over grilled/charred to a crisp. Unfortunately due to the over grilling some of the meat was tasteless and hard to eat. Will definitely go back some time to try some other items on the menu.  The price of the meal and drinks seems to follow a local trend, where probably a little pricey for what you get, but still overall a good meal and good place to enjoy the cuisine.",

Whenever I go to a place for tacos, I'm expecting one of two things... either mass quantities of grub on the cheap or in-your-face quality and flavor. Two Hippies Beach House takes care of the former. The service was friendly, and the chow is okay, not bad, but not outstanding in the slightest. It's truly perfect as a quick and filling meal that you can mow down with a few friends before going out to the bar or for when you are getting back from the bar. And that, to me, has it's own special place in the restaurant food chain. For $5 flat I can walk away with three giant tacos loaded with plenty of ruffage to extinguish my appetite. Throw in some green salsa with those tacos and I'm content. There's no doubt that I'll be back soon enough.",

Good friend from Louisiana told me about this place and her food. So I got in my car and had to check them out right away.\n\nInside is very casual with a vibe that reminds me a eating in one of those smaller towns down south. Decor is very simple with touches of the bayou and it's critters sprinkled here and there. The smell of the food instantly puts me right into the zone.\n\nReally love the Cajun Food and the Cool Cajun Zydeco music playing playing in the back ground. They have both a lunch menu and a larger dinner menu. You can order off the dinner menu at lunch if you are really hungry. The portions are bigger and there are more choices.\n\nSo far we have tried the Dunkin Catfish, the Alligator and Crawfish Po-Boys and both of the Gumbos. How can you go wrong with Catfish placed on top of rice and then covered with Crawfish Etouffee. We also tried the fried Green Tomatoes on our last visit.\n\nThe food is cooked and seasoned with tender loving care. Everything taste fresh and the prices are very affordable. You can always add some extra heat by choosing one of the hot sauces to kick things up a notch.\n\nService is friendly and helpful. This is not a well polished chain restaurant with robots reading scripted dribble. Just great food with a fun and tasty menu.\n\nUse your GPS if you are coming from way across town. They are located in a large shopping center towards the back and the sign is a little hard to see from the street. PARTY IN MY MOUTH!\n\n4.5 STARS",

(He had been here before, but I had not.)  No offense to the SMG, but on a semi-discounted mid-day week day, this was worth the price of admission and then some!  Really, comparing these two are like apples and oranges, or more like Ruth's Chris to In 'n Out Burger.  Both are great at what they offer, but it depends upon what you want out of the experience.\n\nFirst of all, this felt like a real date with my hubby . . . the all out wine and dine with a movie. We were in the high-end seats which recline, and ones that are just two together, instead of an entire row of seats. I didn't notice anything else going on in the theater. Contrary to some people's opinions, the servers never distracted my view. This has always been a problem for me at SMG as servers are always ducking in front of the screen.  Not so at iPic.  We also ordered off the menu -- we were both delighted with appearance and taste of everything we ordered . . . The Chinois Chicken Salad Rolls were delicious and filling. The Buffalo Chicken Spring Rolls were heavenly. You could taste all the flavors of the blue cheese and buffalo sauce with tender chicken. And lastly, we had the Loaded House Baked Potato Chips -- plenty to share . . . for two or maybe even more.\n\nThe menu at the adjoining restaurant Tanzy looked tempting, so next time we might have brunch first on the weekend and then do the movie. \n\nBravo to iPic . . . an Academy Award in my book!",

Places my order and we drove down there picked up food and came home. I should have checked the food but I assumed bc it was online with a print already clear for them it would be fine. It wasn't. I guess somebody else had ordered a very similar order to ours. And they mixed it up. I was upset but they refunded my money back and I was whatever about it. The wings were alright nothing special. It's hard to say how good they were since it wasnt what I ordered. Fries were soggy and not seasoned. My second or third chicken wing I found the longest black hair ever. I stopped eating obviously. This kinda pushed the whole experience over the edge. Even my boyfriend who loved the wingstop in Texas said it wasn't as good. Probably won't ever come back. I only have two stars bc the cashier girl was nice and very apologetic and I got my money back anyways. This place is over hyped.",

My 2 kids are pizza addicts so where better to take them on a Saturday for lunch?  \n\nThis location seems to be up and coming and there was plenty of bustle going on.  Walked in and as I explained to my family, this is like a Subway for pizza.  Pick the base and walk down the line.  Everyone working there was super friendly and since it's new they took their time to explain everything to you.  I went with the white pizza, add grilled onions and roasted garlic.  Very tasty.  My oldest daughter has celiac and we were happy to know they offer a gluten free crust, they also take the care to wipe everything down when they press the dough which was much appreciated.  3 pizza's, 4 drinks were right at $36.00 (Gluten free adds a bit).\n\nGreat concept and good place for a quick bite.  I will say one negative, and the music inside was so darn loud!!  Maybe I'm just getting old :-)",

The decor is cute, slightly weird, but cute.  The servers wear pajamas and it took me a minute to realize it!\n\nAs for food, it's pretty underwhelming.  It's not terrible, but I was not impressed- no bold flavors.  The \"bread in a pot\" was bland and the chicken and waffles were pretty bland, too.  I won't ever be returning because I like a little more excitement when eating carbs and other foods in general.  \n\nThere are so many better breakfast places in Las Vegas, skip this one!",

Food highlights: free popovers, lobster bisque. \n\n* Popovers - 5 stars: The BEST, small, light, airy, chewy, you could almost stuff the entire thing in your mouth. I've had good popovers at NM, but like the texture and size of these more. AND they give you a huge plate of softened salted butter - WINNER.\n* Lobster Bisque - 4.5 stars: One of the better lobster bisque's I've had! Great overall flavor, rich and decadent.\n* Side of mushrooms, creamed corn, fingerling potatoes - 3.5 stars: All of these were good. 3 kinds of mushrooms cooked generously in butter, my favorite. Followed by the creamed corn, very different with a strong jalapeno flavor. Fingerling potatoes standard.\n* Banana Cream Pie - 3.5 stars: Emerill's famous banana cream pie is huge - stacked high with chunks of fresh banana. The cream needed more banana flavor, seemed overwhipped, and the crust could've been more buttery. Was still good though.\n* Key Lime Pie - 3.5 stars: Really good key lime pie on an excellent crust, a little too sweet for me though.\n* German chocolate cake - 2 stars: Cake tasted airy, reminded me of box cake. Prefer Duncan Hines (sorry!).\n* Chateaubriand - 2.5 stars: Had an incredibly tender well-seasoned Tomahawk at Beauty and Essex, and in close second was Carnevino's. The Chateaubriand is a hunk of meat for two, sliced and cooked tableside. The meat was tender, but the texture kind of reminded me of a pot roast (not a fan), and it had a bit of a weird, gamey flavor....Recommend sticking with the ribeye.",

Nope!\n\nInstead we waited until we couldnt get in to a local Chandler steakhouse and my husband really wanted steak.\n\nAs a rule of thumb I generally try to stay away from nationwide chain restaurants so I really can only blame myself.\n\nIf you have read any of my reviews you know two things about me.\n\nI am super picky but do not mind spending the bucks if the food warrants it\n\nI hail from Chicago ... Used to go see the stockyards where the some of the best beef came from... Favorite Chicago steakhouse... Gene and Georgetti's\n\nMy point is I grew up with good meat and I know the difference!\n\nWe walked in mid afternoon knowing we would never get in at night without a reservation . \n\nGreeted by several smiling employees... We Chose to sit outside as it is a beautiful day.\n\nService was good ... Food? Not so much...\n\nAlthough I have never been , I am guessing it is similar to  Outback Steakhouse... Generic food.\n\nHusband and I each got the \"Manhattan cut\" I believe the price $23.00  we upgraded to get the salad ( one of the most unappealing and boring house salads ever))...\n\nThe steak which was cooked correctly! (Thank you) but truly uneventful as well.  \n\nThere was a thick piece of fat/grizzle on this small piece of meat and it took a lot of sawing with the knife to cut thu the meat ...  the seasoning was fine... Not too much... Not too little.\n\nThe double baked potatoe was ok... Just a double baked potatoe.. Nothing at all special and green beans were green beans.. No seasoning... Just beans\n\n\nOh yes... Don't want to forget to mention the bread... Small round of what I think is supposed to be sourdough... Although it was warm it was truly nothing special.\n\nNo dessert... As thus far it was clear we were spending good money on not so good/average food...no point in wasting more money.\n\nI do want to point out the patio is a nice space with a fireplace and comfy Chairs and couches ... Perfect to unwind after shopping !\n\nAnd the service was top notch... Of course the patio was not very crowded...\n\nIt is my opinion if you enjoy the chain restaurants like Outback and Red lobster and those types of places THE KEGis right up your alley!\n\nIf you are looking for a cut of real Midwest beef then you may want to go to EDDIE V's, or CHOP HOUSE or something of that nature...\n\nWe left paying the $75.00 tab knowing we would not return.\n\nI suggest you give it a try and enjoy it for what it is!  I understand they have a decent happy hour... \n\nUntil then.....\n\nBon appetite'",

Today I went with my best foodie buddy for lunch.   Now I sit, stuffed to the gills and happy.  \n\nTHE FOOD:  Fresh, local, seasonal and healthy.  \n\nThere is a continuum of duck  On one end, there is greazzy, mushy undercooked slime, on the other stringy, tough, oily twine.  There is a tiny and beautiful area of canard perfection, where the duck is tender and juicy, yet still firm.  Crop owns that tiny slice of perfection.  Ditto for the lamb.\n\nToday we could not decide what we wanted so we each started with a bowl of tomato, chipotle and bleu cheese soup until we could decide.  If we could have gotten away with licking our bowls in public, we would have.  The soup tasted of fresh tomatoes and smoky chilis, not salt.   We ordered two lunches and split them-- the Pig Mac and the beef Cropicana bowl.  The Pig Mac is a porky bit of heaven comprised of pork loin, pulled pork and bacon with special sauce and fresh pickles all on a sesame seed bun.  Yes, Lisa, the pig is a magic animal.   It was accompanied by a creamy, sweet encini de pepe waldorf salad.  The Cropicana bowl is a Domme version of what Chipotle wishes it could be-- bbq beef, black beans, cilantro sour cream, rice, cheese lettuce and love.  Thank God we've been friends for years, so we could forgive and even appreciate the utter gluttony that ensued.\n\nI've been there when I was on my best manners.  I had the corn chowder and a chicken/apple/camembert sammich.  It took the utmost restraint not to make obscene little moan-y noises whilst eating.  My companion had the Willie Bird-- the coolest take on a turkey sammich you will ever eat.  I didn't know him well enough to eat off his plate.  Dang.\n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE:  It is a nice, wide open area with comfy velvet booths.  The kitchen is open.  Decorations are hip takes on the notion of crops-- macro photos of fruit, wheat sheaved chandeliers...\n\nTHE SERVICE;  Very good, friendly, helpful but not intrusive.  The waiters are all foodies.  Take their advice.  \n\nI need a nap, now.",

At $2 each the portion is solid, bigger than most taco shops in the area.  You can choose corn or flower tortilla and there are several meat options to choose from: Asada, Pollo, Lengua, Tripas, ect... \n\nThe best part is the salsa's and sides.  Even when I hit the drive thru, I receive a huge container of shredded cabbage, fresh sliced cucumbers, fresh pico de gallo, and slices of limes all included without even having to ask.  Their avocado guacamole sauce is better than anyone else's, I always ask for extra green sauce!!  \n\nAsadero Toro is a clear cut winner in a city riddled with taco joints, worth the trip if your reading this :-)",

I added avocado (four slices) for two dollars and swapped fries for a side salad (that is placed in a small side dish) for an additional two dollars. Overall, the price for this entree was TWENTY DOLLARS. Everyone else enjoyed their food - I found the burger to taste too close to meat which set me off and made me nauseated. I found the entrees to be rather overpriced for what they were. The waitress was prompt.

I like the rosemany chicken with real or faux chicken.  The lamb, steak, eggplant, faux meat and other pasty(s) are creative flavorful recipes, and this is a one of a kind joint not to be missed.  Kudos to pasties.",

Today my husband surprised me with a trip to get coffee from here. \nHuman bean is a small drive up coffee shop with a walk up window as well. It's kinda hidden in the shadow of the Shell station on the corner. I decided to skip the line and use their walk up window. After standing there being ignored for a while I was starting to wonder if the walk up window was something they didn't use. Finally, one girl opened the window and said she'd be with me in a moment. I then over heard one of the two workers that were standing around in back say \" I was wondering what that lady was standing there for.\" Really? What did she think I wanted a hug? Coffee of course! When the first girl came back and asked me my order she seemed almost annoyed that I was there. I asked for a medium hot chocolate and a medium caramel hazelnut mocha latte with an extra shot. She asked me at least twice if I wanted whipped cream on both drinks. Our drinks came out after another five minutes. I get that they were busy and I'm totally willing to wait for awesome coffee, but wow talk about disappointing. Joel's hot chocolate was basically hot milk. There was hardly any tinge of chocolate. Mine was ok, but it wasn't strong at all and I didn't taste any caramel and only a slight hazelnut flavor. \nI could over look the attitude and the wait if the coffee was good, but sadly it wasn't anything that special. It's sad when your favorite part is the chocolate covered espresso bean. If you like hot milk then the Human Bean is for you, but if not save your time and money.",

One thing I like about Kung Fu Tea is that they let you customize the drink to have wow boba which is brown sugar based or go with the original honey boba. I can also customize the sweetness so that it's better for me (haha who am I kidding) it's delicious and unhealthy!\n\nSome of the others die by the Wintermelon tea or the Pomelo Kung Fu Tea which has chunks of pomelo in it. They seem to always get nata jelly or red bean in it but I prefer this drink the way it comes. Always delicious.\n\nAnother thing to note is they have a stamp card or the app, so make sure to use it to earn your free boba!\n\nCan hardly wait to come back again!",

        "text": "Let's start with the obvious: It's it not on the Strip. This is not a problem for me personally, but I am a local, so hey, I have no need for Strip accommodations. I guess I really don't have any need for accommodations as I have a house, but we have been getting free room offers in the mail, so why not? \n\nI have always been a fan of the casino. The architecture may be underappreciated because it is simple, but it pulls off clean, mid-century modern inspiration beautifully. The space is comfortable, welcoming, spacious and well lit--neither too dark or too light. Granted, I am not a gambler, so I am not sure if the gaming experience matches the aesthetic experience, but my mom seems to like the slots just fine. \n\nI enjoy the rooms here. They are large, well furnished with modern touches and delightful bathrooms. Yes, delightful! They are big with a huge, separate bathtub with its own television, double vanities, separate toilet room with a sliding door and a nice shower (although I don't adore the shower heads). If you get a pool facing room, you will also have beautiful views. I can see very little to complain about with the rooms. They might not have the latest technology or the most television channels (They do have HBO), and they don't have in-room teas, but, these are still very nice rooms. The beds are big and comfortable. Note: The pillows are very soft. \n\nThe pool area is big and nice. My only real complaint is that the drinks are pricey. If you are a local, don't try to hit the pool on the weekends. Wristbands and room keys are required, or you have to pay $35!\n\nNow, my favorite amenity is the spa! I don't get services, so I can't comment on the massages, but I enjoy the steam and sauna immensely. The steam room has a therapeutic eucalyptus scent, which I appreciate. Plus, the entire space is clean and well maintained with super attentive attendants, and today while I was there, I was the only lady actually using the steam and sauna. I felt like I had a private spa. That's the luxurious life! Sometimes I start to wonder if it is worth trekking down the road to take advantage of the free nights, but from now on, I will remember the spa. It definitely makes it worth it!\n\nMy minor complaints: I don't think they have good dining options at Red Rock, and I think their bar/lounge scene isn't the hippest. But, all that just melts away when you're lounging in the steam room.",

Inside, it is cramped and organized in a way that does not make sense. If you have a cart, get ready to squeeze your way past people because there is barely any room in the aisles. Although this market has a variety of Asian goods, it is primarily a Korean market. Probably my fault for coming here in the first place because it's named Greenland KOREAN supermarket, but be aware that if you are looking for Japanese ingredients it might be difficult to find what you need. \n\nI was looking for packaged mochi for the New Year, and the kind I usually buy does not need refrigeration. After looking alllllll over the store, I finally found it shoved between Korean rice cakes in a corner of the refrigerated section. They also did not carry a vegetable that is commonly used in Japanese New Year cooking, which I found at 168 last year. \n\nEven though I was after specific things, I don't feel as though my shopping trip here should have been so frustrating and claustrophobic.",

Good amount of seating in and out. As a grad student, I LOVE the study room with desks!!! However, the outlets are hard to use unless you have a long cord... My iPad charger cord doesn't reach from the wall around the front of the desk, and there is no way to have it come up from the back of the desk. Only a few of the desks have good lighting (would like to save my eye sight thank you), and there needs to be a sign or something on the door stating priority to people who want to quietly study. That room and the study environment is what keeps me here... If I can't study, I have to go elsewhere, no matter how much I like a place. Every now and then, people who just want to socialize will use the slightly bigger table in that room... Not cool, esp if there are tables/seating in the other areas. Ruins that environment for everyone else in there. Hence the 3 stars",

It was quite crowded, but service was prompt and friendly.\nI started with the Eggplant Pizzettes for an appetizer - crispy, breaded eggplant, creamy ricotta and well-seasoned tomato sauce were all delicious.\nTheir pizzas can be made with either of two crust styles: A round New York style thin crust or a square, thick crusted Sicialian pan style.  I was able to sample both.  We ordered the Di Fara Special which comes on the thick, square crust and it was fantastic.  The crust had that super crispy fried edge along the bottom that comes from being baked in an iron skillet.  It was topped with pepperoni and it was apparent that the ingredients were quality -thick cut, spicy pepperoni with fresh mozzarella, grana padano and a flavorful tomato sauce.  Each piece was quite hardy and it didn't take much to fill me up.\nThe other pizza we ordered was the Bianca on a thin crust.  This crust was not quite as thin as some New York style I have had, but the flavor of the dough was great and stood up to the toppings of garlic, basil, ricotta and cheese.\nI would have a hard time picking a favorite between the two pizzas and will most likely order one of each the next time I go.  And since I am secretly addicted to pouring Green Tabasco all over my pizza, the leftovers were almost better than the first night.  Especially with the garlic in the Bianca seeming to mellow and penetrate the remaining toppings.  \n\nThere was a line waiting to be seated as we finished eating, but our server did not try to rush us, which I appreciate.  I just hope they can maintain their quality, because I will definitely be returning soon.",

        "text": "Man... the cheesecake factory. I loved this place when I was like 8 years old and they were only located in california. Now, it is just a strange experience. It's strange because people line up to come here and wait an hour sometimes.... for what? The food is mediocre at best and it's incredibly overpriced. Anyway, my brother had given me a gift card to this restaurant for chrisanuka. So I finally got around to using it last night. I was in class until 8 and needed to go someplace that was open late (and since we had the gift card, this was the place). The first thing I really hate about this restaurant is the menu size. It is totally unnecessary and every time I go here I just sit and stare at the menu for ever before figuring out what I want. And it's not because it is all too good, It is trying to figure what type of food do I want, what isn't going to be incredibly ridiculously unhealthy, and what isn't 15$ because that is just too much to be spending on a mediocre meal in a chain restaurant. I could go to a pretty good local restaurant and pay the same. Also, with such a big menu I wonder how much of it could possibly be fresh... everything on their menu can't be ordered everyday...? I don't know. So last night I finally decided on the Saigon chicken sandwich with a side salad and the BF got the club. Both were fine, at least with the sandwiches the portion size isn't quite so crazy. \n\nKind of on a side note, our waitress last night was really strange. I think she was putting on an accent and she kept including herself in her questions ie Would we like some pepper on our salad? (um I don't know, would you, creepy waitress lady?) Also, I don't know if the restaurant changed, or what, but she spouted off a 5 minute speech when we got there about the menu (and on page 5 you will find this item, and on page 7, this item).... that was really strange. I have the menu right in front of me.... it is large, so maybe I need direction around it, but generally I can read.\n\nSo anyway, for two sandwiches, no drinks, we paid 27$. That is insane. But we had the gift card, so it turned out alright.... but seriously... why do people eat here? I do not understand it! What is the appeal!!!?!?!?!?!\n\n\nOk sorry for the rant.",

It's true, the baked goods are very much like 85C, and so are the prices! \n\nWhile the building itself is quite big, the pick your own pastries section is in a smallish area off to the side. There was a pretty good selection available in the cases though. Everything was neatly arranged with breads in one section, tarts in another, etc. Unfortunately when we got here around 5 a few of their selections were sold out but it wasn't as bad as the other Asian bakery that opened up recently where it's a barren dessert desert in the late afternoon to evening. I managed to snag the very last Portuguese tart and Hokkaido cream cheese tart and also got the walnut charcoal bread, green tea mushroom bread and an orange sponge cake.\n\nOut of the two tarts I preferred the Portuguese tart with its rich creamy custard, caramelized top, and fluffy layered crust. The crust on the Hokkaido tart was dense and crumbly, while the filling was very creamy with a light cream cheese flavor. \n\nThe walnut bread is like the fruitcake of bread. I didn't taste or see any of the advertised charcoal but it was layered with a lot of fruit and nuts with a chewy dense crumb. I wasn't a fan of the green tea mushroom bread. It had the floral essence of (Jasmine?) green tea with some yellow bean paste. There wasn't a lot of mushroom in the bread, just a few pieces. The whole combination of floral green tea flavor with savory mushroom and sweet paste was weird to me. The bread itself was dense and chewy.\n\nI really liked the fluffy soft texture of the orange sponge cake but I didn't taste any orange flavor. The sugar level was perfect for me, just lightly sweet. \n\nI had hoped to redeem the screenshot offer on Yelp for 10% off but it turns out that offer was reserved for only the first 200 customers. Well I'm assuming they've surpassed that number for some time so perhaps they should adjust their Yelp page!\n\nThe total was very reasonable, a little over $10 for the baked goods whose prices ranged from $1.50 to $2+ dollars. I'll be back to try more pastries and to get some delicious sounding Taiwanese dishes on their food menu!",

And we all are biased when it comes to BBQ because we all have different tastes.  Some love smoke, some love spice, some love sauce, some love tomato-based, some love mustard-based, and some love vinegar-based.  Hell, some folks even love BOILED ribs!  Just as a note people, boiled meats are NOT BBQ.\n\nThis was our meal when we visited Downtown Container Park.  It looked interesting because when we where there, this place had the longest line.  Figure the food must be the best around, right?  Well, yes and no.  It is arguably one of the best places to eat within the park.  But for BBQ it's not my favorite.  But still good for what it is.\n\nWe had the two item combo platter of pulled pork and hot link.  The platter came with a roll, and two sides.  Most popular items leaving the kitchen that day were the mac & cheese, and the baked beans.  We ended up trying those.  We also picked up an extra hot link sandwich to try.\n\nVerdict?  As I said before, good but not great.  The pulled pork was a bit on the dry side and was light on flavor, but good on smoke.  The sides were OK - the mac & cheese was yummy but needed a bit more cheese.  The baked beans were decent, not overly sweet and I think there may have been bits of pork in it.\n\nThe star of the show was the hot link.  These I liked very much!  Spicy, good flavor, and good texture.  They had a great chew when you bit in to one, nice snap.  Delicious on the hot link sandwich.  Their BBQ sauce isn't bad either, tomato-based, it appeals to those who like a sweeter sauce.  Slather this all over your hot link sandwich and it was good eats.\n\nReason why it's down a 1/2 star is the darn pricing.  Whoa, I get it, everything in Downtown Container Park is pricey!  I mean for $12 on a two item combo platter I was expecting a bit more food.  It's good for one person, a bit difficult for two to share.  The sandwiches are $7 each but don't come with a side.  It will cost you $2 more to add that on.  Adding on a soft drink will tack on another $2.  Don't go to Big Ern's BBQ expecting a cheap meal!  But then again don't go to Downtown Container Park and expect anything on the cheap.",

I chose the Chipotle barbacoa bowl with brown rice, pico de gallo, white cheese, lettuce and black beans. It was a flavorful meal. Next time, I will attempt to demonstrate some restraint and save the other half for a later meal. \n\nMy daughter had the burrito. I wasn't a fan of how thick the wheat tortilla was. The steak was okay. The guacamole was an extra $1.95, but it was a generous portion. \n\nWe enjoyed a large Izze Mandarin drink with our meal. I look forward to coming back and trying the carnitas next.",

Besides that, they have less than 10 main dishes to choose from, and it's pretty much only the standard things my white friends always order - beef/chic broccoli, orange beef/chic, mongolian beef, etc. \n\nWe did a bunch of stuff for 6 family style. Things that were good: nothing. Things that were decent: fried rice, hot braised shrimp (aka sweet sour shrimp), siu mai. Things that were crap - everything else we ordered. Pass on the following: pot stickers, beef curry stew, kung pao chicken, mongolian beef, orange chicken, egg roll/spring rolls. Food was bland, and nothing \"spicy\" actually was despite the presence of chili peppers.\n\nIf you insist on staying here to have asian food, you can probably get comparable quality stuff for less from the panda express type place at the food court - think it's called wasabi jane?  It probably even includes mediocre fried rice and a stale egg roll with your meal. Or if you want a sit down experience, Zine at Palazzo is priced slightly more, but with a much better menu. I'm not a huge fan of their food either, but if you really must do overpriced chinese food at this hotel, Zine is the one to go for. \n\nAn asian food court is supposed to open at Palazzo off the casino floor eventually, so it's nice to know there are potentially better options coming soon.",

Although I've never been too big a fan of their customer service, I still continue to stock up on my wine and beer here because they have great prices and an awesome selection. One time, I was told to purchase a certain bottle of Chardonnay by one of the associates and he stated that I should really like it. When I got home and had a glass, it was probably the most disgusting thing I've ever had. On my next visit to total wine, I communicated to the gentleman who suggested it to me that I did not care for it. He had said if I had brought that bottle back rather than throwing it out, they would have replaced it with something else. Knowing this, the next time, and yes there was a next time, I got a bad bottle of wine I returned it to the store and exchanged it with no issues. It almost tasted like it had already been open for days I think the term for that is oxidized? Fast-forward several months later, I had purchased a bottle of Sterling Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa Valley. I've had this wine dozens of times before and I've always enjoyed it. It's not cheap at $27 a bottle. When I got it home, I poured a glass tasted it and it tasted like rubbing alcohol. Again not sure the term but I think it's oxidized. So, I headed back to the store to attempt to exchange it for something else. The manager I spoke to, and of course I can't remember his name, told me \"there's nothing we can do\". No exchange, no refunds, not even an I'm sorry, nothing literally nothing this guy did nothing. You could've at least give me a coupon or something! I've spent thousands of dollars here and I am completely offended by the way that I was treated. If you buy a $27 a bottle of wine and you take it home and the product is bad  somebody should take care of that and not just brush me off like oh I guess you're just sol very disappointed and probably need to find a different place to shop for my beer and wine\n\nUPDATE \n\nChanging my review from two stars to one star. The customer service at this location is atrocious. I was there recently making a purchase when a large sign fell on me ripping my earring out of my ear and cutting my wrist. When I brought this to the attention of the manager his only response was do you want a bandaid? I didn't realize my earring was missing until after I had left. When I went back to retrieve my earring a couple of days later I was greeted with the same terrible customer service. The woman that I spoke with when I was trying to explain the situation to her told me I have no idea what you're talking about and rolled her eyes. I can't keep going back it's just not worth the headache and then treated like this. Next time something may fall on me and actually hurt me and nobody will care. I didn't get a single I'm sorry not a smile nothing.",

The beer was great but it is hard to screw up a mass produced bottled beer. The burger and fries came out without too much of a wait but the quality was lacking. Oh sure, the burger looked amazing. And the fries, as far as the appearance of fries goes, looked pretty good too. An even cook with liberal seasoning. But upon first bite of each, I questioned whether or not this food was fresh. The fries were barely warm and the burger only slightly warmer. The gooey cheese I was looking for hardly gooed at all. The Jack Daniels sauce to drench the burger in had good flavor but seemed thinned by a liquid other than its name sake. Most dripped right off the burger by the time I finished it. I could not help but wonder how much sooner my food would have come to me had it been brought immediately after preparation. I mean, my burger was cooked beyond my request of medium and still wasn't sizzling when I got it. Kind of disappointing.",

It came with 2 shrimp, 3 pcs of the cod+ 1 smaller pc for yelp check-in, 2 scallopp pcs, all over a bed of fries.   The star was definitely the large pieces of white cod meat covered in a thin layer of crispy batter.  The food came out fresh and fast, and I was really impressed with the thin layer of batter.  \n\nThe dipping sauces like tartar, cocktail sauce for the shrimp along with vinegar and ketchup for the fries were all delicious.  If I had to complain, I like my fries a little more well done to get that crisp. Either way, we devoured that dish and it was perfect for sharing.  \n\nOverall, fresh seafood makes excellent fried food.  The beautiful white meat from the cod is super tender and easily worth the $18 price tag.",

Different from any other wing place I've been to, you have the ability to customize your wings. Extra crispy, extra saucy, whatever you want.

        "text": "Jordan and I were once big fans of Bahama Breeze.  Their menu was always unique and does offer some healthier options.  Since we live in ShadySide, anytime we found ourselves out in Robinson, we had always made it a point to make a stop.  Our most recent visit, we have both agreed, was our very last.  \nIf you have read my reviews, you may know that I do not like to give bad reviews based on just server performance.  However, it was the ENTIRE EXPERIENCE that has inspired us to give up Corporate Chains like Bahama Breeze completely.\nWe went on rainy Labor Day Monday.  Since I was once a server, whether it's nice our or whether it's crappy out, Labor Day is ALWAYS busy.  People are off and don't want to cook - plain and simple.  Apparently their manager just got hired yesterday because they were extremely under-staffed, and the energy of the place showed it. \nFirst of all, the hostess that greeted us was visibly irritated that people kept flowing through the door; but quoted us a 20 minute wait.  We waited for 60.\nStill, being understanding and patient, we let the mis-quoted wait time slide, even though other patrons were getting more visibly irritated at this fact.  \nWhen we were finally seated, we were seated at a table that faced the open kitchen.  I don't care where we sit - I really don't.  I always appreciated the Open Kitchen at Bahama Breeze; therefore, servers and line cooks couldn't engage in \"bad habits\" or bad food practices.  NOT SO ON THIS OCCASION!   We watched plates being stacked on top of other plates in the window (WHAT?!?!  SERIOUSLY!?!?  I would have been fired from 5 restaurants if I would have done that); we watched servers eating french fries and shrimp right off of people's plates on the line (which I have seen people get fired for!).  Then, after watching servers eat off the plates, they would touch their faces, and then grab the plates to take them to the tables.\nWhile waiting for our server, I hate to sound snobby, but every single server looked like they hadn't showered in a week; therefore, whomever was going to serve us, I was going to be grossed out by their lacking appearance.  Every single server, contrary to the frantic kitchen, was a slow-paced tortoise not giving a crap about the food piling up in the windows, the Expo yelling for food runners, and some guests still not having CLEAN silverware.  Every single server, male or female, was very un-kept, all had hair in their faces, and chewed food in front of their tables.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww. \nWhen our server finally did greet us - OMG she was way over-perky.  Annoyingly perky, scripted, and high-pitched.  When she finally took our food and drink order, our waters came right away; however, it took a few minutes for Jordan to get his beer.\n*(Oh - and did I forget to mention that even during the long wait - that there were still about 20 open tables and 6 servers standing around?*)\nThen the wait for the food.  Jordan and I (who actually met working together as line cooks, 4 years ago) just watched the kitchen drown frantically.  Then I watched the Manager jump on the line - and that's when I knew it was all over from there.  When ANY Front of House manager jumps on the back of the line - just watch out.  Your food is going to SUCK!  Especially when every ticket that comes in, the Manager rolls his eyes.  Um...that is your job isn't it?  To make food and serve it to guests.  If you're rolling eyes dude...then PLEASE do the guests at Bahama Breeze a huge favor and leave and find a different calling.\nAlso - if Bahama Breeze is going to rock the Open Kitchen in the first place - that kitchen better ALWAYS run a tight ship.  Plus - the windows through that open kitchen should at least look they were washed in the morning.  Not caked on grease that hadn't been touched in a week!!!  Does anyone do sidework there?  The mistakes that we saw MAY NOT been so bad, or disgusting, had we not seen them.  But since everything was in plain sight, it made it that much worse, and hard to swallow when we did finally get our food (literally).\nWe saw our plates get put on the line.  And then we saw them sit for 20 minutes.  Without even an extensive knowledge of the menu, Jordan and I probably could have taught their kitchen a lesson or two.  We just watched our food sit there while the Expo and multiple servers just walked pass.  Not their table, not their problem, right?  \nAs we watched our food just sit in the window, our server came over to us and asked \"So how is everything going?\".  Ummm...we really didn't know how to respond - did she really not see we had nothing in front of us besides two waters and one bottle of beer?  I said, \"Oh the water is delicious.  Where is our food?\"\nFinally a different server ran out our food and informed us that the plates were \"really hot.\"  Yeah I know - I saw them sit in a heat lamp for 20 minutes.  \nFood tasted dry...like it had been under a heat lamp for 20 minutes.\nNeed I say more?",

It was solid breakfast food, nothing really stood out to us but it had a good looking menu. They have Oreo and funfetti pancakes so you have some unique variety here. Probably would try one of them next time. \n\nThe interior is super cute. Lots of turquoise, a mural of Chicago on the wall, it's clean and a cool vibe for a breakfast place. We felt the tables were a bit crammed together but hey, gotta maximize your space. \n\nOur waitress was nice enough and made sure that everything we ordered came out, that we had syrup, etc. \n\nThe food was where we got pretty hit and miss. Nothing was absolutely horrible, we just weren't impressed with parts of it. \n\nChicken and waffles: I really, really like that they specified the chicken was two pieces of dark meat on their menu. A lot of places don't say so you either have to ask or you just get surprised. That being said, I'm usually not a huge dark meat person but I REALLY liked the chicken. Whatever the coating was I thought complimented it well. It wasn't too dry, it was super tasty. The waffle was okay. It's a pretty light and fluffy Belgian so that was good. There must have just been something in the batter I wasn't crazy about. Could have been better, could have been worse. It came with a side of sriracha syrup which I thought went well with the chicken, but if you eat your waffle separately I'd go with regular syrup on that. $10 \n\nCaptain crunch French toast: cool to see a unique flavor on the menu, you could definitely taste the captain crunch to go with the French toast. If you like the cereal its enjoyable but we likely wouldn't order it again. Not bad though. $9.50\n\nFruit bowl: as far as the selection of fruit goes, it was a good variety and a decent sized bowl. Two of us easily split it. However, most of the fruit we got was on the mushy side. Perhaps we just came on an off day. For $6 it was a good size but quality wise felt a little let down. \n\nWe also got an iced tea $3 and a glass of milk $2.50. Overall I thought the prices were pretty decent. Another nice thing was the water glasses and soda glasses were pretty big. I kind of hate when I go somewhere with tiny water glasses, especially during the summer in AZ. These did not disappoint.",

        "text": "I recently went to Sierra Bonita for a really delicious brunch. I've been in the mood lately for biscuits and gravy and this place made my afternoon with a fantastic southwestern version named Verde Vaqueros. The salty sausage gravy was just about perfect and generously poured over each biscuit. The biscuits were also served with some scrambled eggs and a couple strips of bacon that were light and tasted very fresh. \n\nI also got to try the guacamole, tamale app and a few bites of the stacked enchiladas. They were all very very good. The guac was a perfect blend of ripe avocados, diced onion, cilantro and a little lime juice; the serving size wasn't to shabby either. The tamale app was just a single tamale, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that is really hungry and would like to spend $5 more wisely. Finally, the enchilada... It was wonderful and with a fried egg nest on top, it was perfecto. The chicken, the tortillas, the beans and the cheese came together to make an excellent southwestern flavor.\n\nSierra Bonita was great for brunch and I'm excited to go back at another time of day to hopefully have a similar experience.",

I have been to Souper Salad many times before and I expected it to be similar but better.\n\nWell, I will start with the good.\n\nOkay and now the so-so. I had the chocolate bread muffin. It was tasty, and chocolaty, but dark chocolaty. Not sweet at all really. Like I said, it was good but as it was not sweet, it was not dessert, and as it was chocolate it didn't really go with anything else.\nI moved on to try the chocolate bread pudding concoction they had. That was REALLY good, but it was almost gone so I only got the edges. I got hardly any of the gooey chocolaty messiness that I truly wanted. This dessert probably would have been in the good category if I had gotten some 5-20 minutes earlier.\n\nAnd now for the bad. I'll just start from beginning to end. Raw beets = not good! Dry, stale spit most of my first bite out. The light ranch tasted like it was on the verge of going bad. The regular ranch was watered down. They were out of Coke, Dr. Pepper and Rootbeer and only had ice at the cashiers station, not in the soda fountain. The Chinese orange happy chicken salad had no chicken and I was not happy! I moved onto the soups. First I tried the 3-cheese tortellini soup. I couldn't taste any cheese and the tortellini was mush.\nThe broth was flavorful but I still only had 3 bites. I moved on to the Irish Potato and Leek soup. It was pretty tasty actually but I still had to doctor it up with salt pepper and cream cheese because it was otherwise rather bland. I also took a bite of the chicken noodle soup. It had big chunks of chicken in it. Big, dry, overcooked pieces of chicken. It was also bland. Should have had some veggies in it. The mac n \"cheese\" was soupy and also bland.\nYou won't catch me back here anytime soon!",

The flavors range from bubble gum and marshmallow to pickle and hurricane.  Mac's also has its own signature concoctions.\n\nSundaes and banana splits are also on the menu, and for an average of $5 it is definitely worth it.  I just would not recommend coming here to eat.\n\nThe food is unremarkable and lacks the kind of flavor and texture that would make it memorable.\n\nFor hot summer days, date nights, and sweet rewards, a little venture through time, definitely worth a visit.",

The steaks were easily 12-15 oz. Everyone is served a salad to start and family style Spanish rice, vegetables, and Spanish potatoes (which are like homemade chips) with the entrees. As appetizers our table got the stuffed mushrooms and flambe Portuguese sausage which they bring to the table in a flaming cast iron pig shaped dish. \n\nThe waitstaff is also super attentive...quickly taking away dirty dishes, refilling water, and giving us more bread/butter all before we even notice we've even run low. \n\nAmazing service, even more amazing food. 5 stars all around!",

NoDa has recently started canning beers so you can find them at a lot of local grocery stores which is awesome.  \n\nThe atmosphere in the brewery is pretty lively and it fills up not long after it opens, especially on the weekends.  They've had to open up some additional parking across the street to accommodate the growing crowd.  There is the indoor brew hall area and an outside area with cornhole boards and whatnot.  \n\nYou will not find food here, but there are food trucks that post up right there in the parking lot.  There's a schedule on the NoDa Brewery website so you can keep track of which trucks are coming and when.  \n\nWord on the street is that they will be looking to expand soon!  I don't know what that would mean for the current location but hope that they keep it because it has become a staple of the neighborhood in a very short period of time.",

The food here is pretty authentic, but super overpriced, with small portions. There is almost always a short wait to be seated, but they take your order pretty quickly once you're at a table. I've been here a few times, but this is the first time I'm finally writing a review. I've tried:\n\n-Cantonese Dumpling Noodle (Shrimp Dumplings w/Bamboo Shoots, Mushrooms, in Rich Broth, $15.50): Definitely not worth the price since this is typically a bland dish. The dumplings are good but you only get like, three.\n-Mandarin Beef Stew Noodle (Beef Brisket, Tendons-Spiced Herb Broth, $18.75): Really flavorful actually, and they give you a generous amount of beef stew. You can also request for no tendons if you prefer.\n-Laksa Curry Noodle (Chicken, Fish Cake, Bean Sprouts, Dried Shrimp Paste, Egg, in Rich Coconut Curry Broth, $17): Yum- this is one of our go to dishes. The broth is super flavorful, with the perfect amount of coconut milk in it, and the noodles and other ingredients work very well together. It has a decent amount of spice, so don't get this if you hate spicy food. Otherwise, a must order!\n-XO Crabmeat Vermicelli (Lump Crab, Egg, Bean Sprouts, Cabbage, XO Sauce, $23.75): Despite the hefty price tag, they do give you a decent amount of crab, and this dish is actually pretty big although it doesn't look that way when it first comes out. It was good, but not so great I would order it again for the price.\n-Scallop Dumpling & Almond Shrimp Dumpling  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/noodles-las-vegas-2?select=kcv1w_k60jxA_5EsAJX1Mg#kcv1w_k60jxA_5EsAJX1Mg): Both were not very good. The scallop was on the gross side since there was barely any scallop and instead a lot of fillers like water chestnut. The Almond Shrimp was bland, but at least there was a good amount of shrimp. I wouldn't order either again though.\n\nI've tried a couple of their other dim sum items like Har Gow and Shiu Mai, and they were good, but if you really want dim sum, you might as well take a cab to the Chinatown area and get a full dim sum meal there. The cost will probably work out to be the same, or cheaper depending on how big your group is. Although the food here is pretty good, the prices are so expensive it makes me cringe as a cheap Asian person! With that being said, I'll probably still be dragged here again on my next trip and just order the Laksa noodles.",

Minuscule amount of meat inside and dropped with liquid like it had been microwaved. I had to send that back as well. The waiter seemed very confused about why I was sending the food back, really offered no solution nor did he care that my meal consisted of eating off everyone else's plates at my table. Never re filled chips when we asked either. So poor service and very poor food quality tonight. My friend who got the steak quesadilla showed us how there was such a tiny amount of meat inside as well. Not sure if it was a bad night or they are starting to cut corners and cheapen itself. Food in general is always pretty bland and dry. Chicken dishes always have no flavor and 8/10 times are dry as can be.

        "text": "We picked up a LivingSocial coupon for TBC, and decided to head there for a Sunday lunch. The place is in an old warehouse, which has a cool kind of vibe to it. You walk up and order, and the lady at the counter seemed genuinely uninterested in her job, and gave off a pretty bad vibe to start. I ordered the Pesto Burger and my dad ordered the Buffalo Burger. She asked my dad \"Mild or hot\" and my dad said \"Somewhere in the middle\" and she gave him this kind of are you kidding me stare. Bad start. We also got onion rings and fries with drinks, and it came out to be about $21 (10 with the coupon).\n\nThe food came out quickly, and I took a bite of my burger. The first thing I noticed was the bad bun. It's like a simple white bun that is...mealy. Not good. The patty was pretty good, and the little pesto sauce it had was good as well. The cheese was all right. Next I had a french fry...oh my, these were worse than any place I've been to in awhile. They were...mealy again, just not good. Ugh. Onion rings were good. My dad said his was okay, but didn't like the crunch associated with the celery on the burger.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't come back here. Bad Daddy's is a much better alternative. I would keep away if I were you unless I lived right in the area.",

This most recent trip for a birthday celebration was really nothing short of great. I even actually opted for seafood this night over red meat.. long week of t-bones and lamb.. haha.. random week.. but anyway. \n\nThe quality of the food is fantastic. The service was spot on without being pretentious or rude, and the overall experience was really pretty wonderful. The staff really made us feel great.. and made every effort to keep our drinks full, bread basket overflowing and meals served promptly. \n\nSeriously, i can say nothing else other than it's also pretty fantastic that they are located off-Strip and thus, requires that you do not have to deal with a huge parking garage. While they have valet available, the parking lot is like 50 feet from the front door if you want to just walk. \n\nI will be back.. again and again.",

Aside from the phenomenal food with flavors that explode in your mouth I was really diggin the 90's throw back tunes that had us all dancing over dinner. It's a bit pricey but well worth it. I would also like to note that everyone who worked there did an incredible job getting everything out quickly and making sure we always had drinks and whatever else we needed...they were also extremely patient with our table who maybe got a little too excited after drinks and throw back tunes. \u200d\n\nNot a fan of the bathrooms. I needed to fix my lipstick after dinner and the mirror is in front of everyone (men and women) waiting in line so they just kind of awkwardly stare at you. Ha!",

        "text": "An overrated stinkhole that failed to deliver good service and food. I wanted to leave this place as soon as we got the check. I looked on at gamblers with envy, at least they had the potential to get their money back. The glitzy massive billboards and numerous reviews that laud this place as one of the best Chinese food restaurants are misleading. Maybe that distinction was right in the past but I couldn't find anything that would qualify as \"best\".  I should've known with a name like Ping Pang Pong. \n\nThe problems began in the beginning. Once seated we were ignored for a good time and my sister had to get up and ask for drinks. The food that came was unmemorable and smelled odd, even for a Chinese restaurant. The Cantonese Princess Chicken was cold, bony, and slathered in oil. Our noodle dish was over seasoned with curry powder and had a pungent odor. It left my stomache feeling uneasy as I was driving home. The only food I liked was the sauteed Chinese brocolli and soup, unfortunately that's not enough to warrant a visit. Overall, I wouldn't recommend coming here especially when there are plenty of better options in the valley.",

        "text": "I've been here a couple times.  It's a very \"white\" boba place.  And a little pricey.  Two larges cost almost $14.  But I'm good with it because it's what I needed.\n\nIt's in the Scottsdale Fashion Plaza so you would expect pricey.  I'm used to the more Asian boba places but finding one that not only did smoothies but also the teas was hard to find.\n\nI went to 2-3 Asian owned places in north Scottsdale to find Thai Tea Boba and to no avail.  What the heck?  Many places in Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert have many varieties of boba drinks.\n\nI guess people in Scottsdale really only like smoothie boba drinks.\n\nSo though a bit more $$ than the places I go to for Boba, I was happy to find what I needed here.  The boba was just right and not hard or too soft.\n\nThe drinks weren't as good as where I go but it'll do and that's why I gave it 4 stars.  5 stars for availability.  3 stars for price.\n\nIt is a pain to park, though.  But covered parking is good.  Just narrow parking garage and people not driving well in the garage.  But that's not the fault of this place.\n\nThey do have lots of varieties of boba drink with names for the drinks.  I'd prefer a simpler menu with single items you could choose from.  But it's ok the way they have it, which I think is more complicated.",

        "text": "Came here late night with my best friend and her co worker! It was literally not the first choice of dining but at 3:30-4 AM there isn't much of a choice in Mandalay Bay. The menu of course is going to be expensive because it's a hotel chain restaurant/deli or whatever. The down fall is that with it being so late they have a very selective menu to choose from so you don't really have many options! Our waiter was an airhead and we had to keep asking him for the necessary things that should've already came automatically such as napkins and water.. After spending over $60 for some basic ass meal I was completely over it because there's no way no breakfast burrito that small should've costed $13 and then the potatoes were basic with no seasoning.. My bf liked the food probably only because he was drunk but other than that I can't see myself eating here again unless I had a food and beverage credit from the hotel, but wait even then idk I would probably choose somewhere else...",

Bf and I got seated same time as four other people and we saw them leave 30 mins before we even got our food - with four to their party vs us with two people. I literally have never had to wait for food this long. We got half order of curry and half order of pad thai so it wasn't like we ordered too much food. I also asked for thai ice tea and our server completely forgot about it.",
