The sides are good, but nothing spectacular.  Still, the service is great and the price is right.",

Stopped by to meet up with some friends for some afternoon drinks. The venue is cozy and totally empty except for a few locals. Totally a local dive bar and the drinks are cheap which at that point you've got me sold. A nice low key casual place to throw back a few. The food I'm not so sure about and once it hit about 7pm the place started to get packed.",

            "text": "Holy hell, what are yelpers thinking?\n\nMy friends and I are on a quest to find the best wings in the 'burgh (and when I say 'burgh, I mean the city... we ain't driving to Monroeville for any wings!) and upon googling \"best wings in Pittsburgh,\" Excuses came up as NUMBER TWO.  We thought we had struck gold (GOLD, Jerry, GOLD!).\n\nWe had struck nothing more than a horse apple (ref: Shawshank Redemption).\n\nAdmittedly, we messed up and showed up on Thursday (versus Wednesday) for wing night.  Our bad.  However, one would think that the wings served on Wednesday are the same as the wings served on Thursday.  If they ARE different, I'll happily try this place again.\n\nAnyway, I walk into a cloud of smoke.  I hate to be a pain about this, but isn't there a law against cigarette smoke in an establishment that serves food (they even have a dining room!)?  This was my first turn off.  I guess I'm \"spoiled\" by having been able to eat in fresh air.\n\nWe claim a table in the back dining area and immediately start checking out the menus - which, btw, were placed neatly on each table.  The bartender comes up and tells us that they are on a \"late night\" menu (WHAT?  It was 7:20pm) and the menus we're looking at are basically just a tease.\n\nOK.  I took a deep breath (coughed) and moved on.\n\n\"So, do you have wings?\"  I ask.\n\"Oh yes, we have wings.\"  Says our server (also the bartender, and worth a mention, very nice and timely with drinks/etc.)\nPHEW\n\"But we only have one flavor.\"\nWHAT?!?\n\nNormally this would be the third strike, but since the googles said they had the NUMBER TWO WINGS in Pittsburgh, we just figured they would be worth it.\n\nSo my group of five decides to tread cautiously and we get 2 dozen wings (hot wings, as that was the only flavor available).  FIVE SECONDS LATER the wings were there.  I'm not exaggerating.  There is quick, and then there is WAY TOO QUICK.  Basically, it was clear to us that these were wings from last night that were either nuked or had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while.\n\nIt gets worse.  They were good sized wings, but since they were \"leftovers\" all the fat was soft and chewy on the wings.  And inside, some of the meat was still pink.  This is a no-go with chicken.  I won't even go into detail on the brown, dried up celery...\n\nThe story ends with us not finishing the wings, heading over to Emiliano's across the street and having a grand ol' time with margaritas and nachos.\n\nI will never, never, never go here again (unless I accidentally wander in inebriated for last call).",

            "text": "Let me start my saying that I really didn't give this place a fair shot.  We were in Pittsburgh for the weekend and were working our way down Carson Street, bar by bar.  This was our 1st stop.  We could only stay for 1 drink because we had a pregnant girl that was with us (not drinking), and the place allowed smoking. \n\nWe had just missed the live band, and didn't get to try any of the food, so I can't speak on behalf of either of those.  \n\nPlace was a good size with plenty of room to move around.  The crowd there was mainly older (40s & 50s).   But with all the room, I was disappointed there was no pool table/dart board.   \n\nThe men's bathroom didn't have a lock on the door and there was no divider between the toilet and the urinal.  This is a pet peeve of mine. Is it really that expensive to install a divider?  So if you go here, don't eat too many wings or you will need someone to stand guard as you use the bathroom.\n\nAnother small annoyance... On the way to the bar we picked up a few bottles of water to bring back to the hotel with us and they made us check in the water and leave it at the entrance.  What is that all about?\n\nOverall, the place was a typical dive bar, nothing special about it.  With a dozen other bars to choose from on the same street, why go here?",

So that's why I'm writing this review.\n\nUpdate: I received this reply from the owner a week later ... so I will up my rating to 3 stars ...\n\nGood Afternoon, \n \nThank you for taking the time to send us an e-mail about a less than satisfactory product you purchased in our bakery last Thursday.  First I have to appolgize for taking so long to get back to you.  As you may know this little shop is owned by our family, and with that we are always busy doing many things.  From Farmer's Markets on both Thursdays and Saturdays,  to baking 125 loaves of bread Saturday with a Church Youth Group for their moms on Sunday, visiting with folks at a local retirement home yesterday and a seminar I had commited to today.  Wow,  it's been a busy week, and that only covers the past 5 days.  I finally had a chance to check my e-mails.  The business e-mails go to my husband and he forwarded yours onto my personal e-mail so that I may answer you.  \n \nAnyways,  I appreciate your patience.  We do bake all of our breakfast rolls every morning.  The one that you purchased wouldn't have been old, but it would have had to have been overbaked to be inedible.  I really sincerely apologize for that.  We do make everything here in the bakery from scratch and with that sometimes leaves room for human error.  \n \nSo to thank you for taking the time to send us an e-mail, I would like to make things right and offer you - your choice a sandwich or any loaf of bread. \n\nMy compliments of course.  I am typically here in the bakery Mon-Wed all day.  Thursday only 'til 1:00 - then off to a Farmers Market.  All day Friday. and another Farmers Market on Saturday.  We are closed on Sundays for family time.  I will be putting your name on our message board with instructions for a Free Sammie or Loaf of Bread.  \n \nWarmly, \nLeslie Walston,  Owner\nGreat Harvest Bread Co. 1730\n___________________________________________________\n\n[update 5/30/10]: I did go back and unfortunately ordered a savannah bar and iced coffee. The savannah bar was okay but small. The iced coffee I had a sinking feeling as I saw the person pull dig the cut in a bucket of ice and proceed to pour hot coffee over it. This is going to water down by 50% an already weak coffee. I asked if she could give me a little less ice, she obliged but that just resulted in a dishwater, luke-warm watery coffee that was undrinkable. So I was foiled again. I sent an email to the owner again suggesting they serve full strenght coffee that's been kept in a refrigerator then poured over ice ... no reply back.\n\nSo I'm sorry to say I've downgraded my rating to 2 starts ** . And I'm sorry to say I will likley not go back. Too disappointing even though I want it to be better.",

I have tried to go here in the past but they have always been very busy so I finally made it.\n\nI wanted to not just order eggs and something, not much variation there so I ordered the biscuit and sausage gravy and French toast. \n\nFirst the good point was the biscuit and gravy, especially the gravy. It was probably the best gravy I have ever had. Very smooth and rich with full flavors of just right salt and pepper. The sausage bits were great and very tasteful. The gravy was definite a 5 star, the biscuit a 3 star. It was nothing special, not flaky or tender, like an afterthought. The waitress convince me to order just a half order, so I thought it must be huge but turned out to be just a normal everyday biscuit. \n\nThe other part of the order was the french toast. This was a disappointment, it was burnt and I came there early so there was no crowd there, so there should be no excuse for that. It was your everyday french toast, nothing to write about, something I could have done in my own kitchen. Last was the coffee, which again was average.\n\nSo I have to give it a 3-1/2 if I knew how  but decided upon 3 for now, because again the gravy was spectacular but the others were average to below average. I hope to go there in the future and maybe try other things and I may change the rating but for now it is that.\n\nJust wanted to say, I came here a couple of more time after the first review, because, first I don't want to judge a place by just one visit.

I asked nicely to please toast my sandwich twice and the employee hist at me then I tried to just ignore it but when she asked what I wanted in the sandwich was a rude tone I said just forget it. I walked to the manager and told just forget my sandwich your employees are not to nice she said ok, never asked why, what happened nothing.  I left  couldn't believe it so I looked up yelp and now I see the problem it wasn't just me this is been going on for a while the corporate office in Utah just doesn't care it's Summerlin they will make  money no matter how they treat you.",

And that's fine. He's clearly new. My problem was that he was asking for help from the management and the girl was being super short with him. Maybe they had a long shift together but it's not like they were in a rush, we were the only people in there. So yeah my sandwich was terrible and I knew it would be when he was making it but I would have been a dick if I said anything while I was there. I was hangry. Anyway I attached a picture of my sandwich after I opened it up at home.\n\nTL;DR: dude fucked my sandwich but management could be bothered to help him even after he asked for help",

Things you can count on from a fish camp style is huge portions, as much hushpuppies as you want, good tea,  and a family friendly environment, with lots of people... On weekends you will find lots of families & groups celebrating this & that or just getting together for dinner.. It isn't a quiet intimate type place.   If part of your party doesn't eat fish they have that covered... If you go on the weekend it is crowed and the servers are working hard, and even though they get your food ot fast, patience is a good thing to bring with you...",

I went up to the girl that was stamping everyone to get it & asked who I could ask to check on an order. She pointed to the same kids laughing & talking. So I politely asked if someone could check on an order, one of the girls (first name started w a Z) turned around & told the girl \"go tell someone else, i need you to come back so I can train you.\" I was furious. It would take you TWO minutes to check on an order. Finally someone giggling said they'll check & 10 minutes later we got our food. It took more than an hour & a half to get our food. NEVER GOING BACK. the manager seems so careless too. So it's not like we got anywhere when we mentioned it to him.",

This latest visit was no exception.  \n\nThis was my first visit to the location on South Boulder Highway.  It is a smaller restaurant with not many table and not much room.  It was kind of crowded on a Saturday afternoon.  Luckily I beat the crowd and had my order before the biggest group of 6 even placed theirs.  I ordered, as mentioned, my customary Spam musubi and a katsu chicken bowl.  The musubi was quite good with a nice slice of Spam, sufficient sauce and the nori wrap was perfectly tender and not too tough.  The katsu bowl was just alright.  The katsu was was perfect and crispy the way it should be.  The broccoli was over cooked and the rice seemed to be headed that way too.  There was katsu sauce on the table but it seemed a bit thin.  It tasted fine and went well on the katsu and rice.  With a little bit of added Sriracha I had a full flavored dish.  I didn't actually finish my bowl.  I left about half the rice since I had just eaten the musubi.  I didn't feel I needed the extra rice.  It was a bit soft for my liking any how.\n\nThis is a small location but it is very clean and colorful.  The inside looks new despite the aging exterior of the building which it occupies.  I may come back here again though there are closer Hawaiian places.  This one happens to be near to the Smith's Grocery I shop at.  It makes it a worth while and convenient stop so I don't have to shop on an empty stomach.",

EVERYTHING on the menu sounds like it would be heaven to eat, and I know everything IS delicious. Being no stranger to 'Hawaiian' food, we welcomed L & L with open arms, into our 'hood. After our weekly grocery shopping trip, the husband and I (finally) stopped in for dinner. We ordered for 5 of us, though it would seem like we were feeding a lot more people LOL. Even the very sweet girl behind the counter joked that she thought we were having  a party with the amount of items we ordered. \n\nWe tried a kalbi mixed plate, chicken katsu mini plates, hawaiian bbq chicken, a spam musubi combo, ahi poke (small size), and I absolutely needed a thai tea boba. Every item was delicious and flavorful. The tea was perfect, and the portion sizes were perfect. The rice was cooked perfectly sticky, the macaroni salad tasted great. The portion sizes were on par with the legendary heaping plate lunch reputation of most Hawaiian food places, and that includes the mini sizes as well. \n\nI noticed while waiting for our food, that the menu had calorie information on it, and the restaurant offers healthy plate lunch options as well. Grilled fish and chicken with veggies and brown rice. Perfect!\n\nWelcome to the 'hood, L & L. So happy you're here!",

            "text": "Update: they have really good pizza 3.5 stars.\n\n\n\n\nThis pains me to leave this review as 2 stars but I have to be open and honest.\n\nI saw on social media that Veganos was opening and was pretty excited about a vegan place opening off Rancho/Cheyenne. I was promised (after asking) via social media that is was not connected to a vegan taco shop on the East side that I despise...so we went. \n\nWe went having an open mind that the photos looked EXACTLY like the other place, with almost EXACTLY the same menu, yet hoped it would be better...it was not.\n\nPretty rough area hubs was hesitant to park the car, the car is not a RR but it's nice. We walked in a saw a nice family eating and a woman in the back. \n\nThe cashier was super timid and just stood there. When she spoke it was sooooo quiet you can hardly hear her. Not sure if she is miserable or just a quiet person. We order a bunch of food and two hibiscus teas.\n\nWe sat and the table was dirty, crumbs and so I wiped them away with the only thing on the table, a paper menu. \n\nOur drinks came and they were gross. I was super sad I just didn't order a bottle of water. I was hungry and thirsty and this hibiscus tasted exactly like ultra sweet koolaide. I tried to drink it again and just couldn't.\n\nChkn taco place came and it had beans and rice. Looked sooooo yummy I was excited! Cheat day starting! I kinda actually liked the chikn in the tacos, it had a sauce, but of course it processed faux so I'm surprised I even ate it. The rice tasted like globs of spiced tomato sauce oily rice and the beans were sooooo bland they were border like opening a can and adding salt. They were just boiled pinto beans. \n\nThe breakfast burrito was uncooked mushy tofu (at least add some Kala Namak and turmeric!) a hella ton of canned mushy jalape\u00f1o and some white onion that was barely saut\u00e9ed...\n\nThe nachos were ok but since asking for no Daiya (and getting some on it anyway) they were also salty and bland. The ascada was horrible, it was vegan Tofurkey sausage links cut up and tossed on the top. Dry and chunky. There were a few plops of guacamole which tasted great and thankfully some cilantro to give something some type of flavor. The chips are the top shelf Cardenas type of chip the triple fried ones...super crispy...super fried. \n\nHubs and I were reahungry and tried to eat the \"food\" anyway. All I could think of was wow can't wait for this conversation in the car.......\n\nWe got in the car and we both agreed we would have rather just went to Taco Bell for the first time in ten years and saved the $35.\n\nI was right...it's just like Panchos Vegan Tacos. Poor quality, wasted calorie vegan junk food. Very sad because it could be soooooooo good!!!!!!\n\nIf you look at my photos it looks GREAT right? It's not. I have an extreme sodium headache and it's bland af.\n\nSave your money and go to Panchos Kitchen on Charleston. You will thank me later.",

            "text": "I visited Veganos Kitchen for the first time in Memorial Day and I ordered the Chorizo breakfast burrito. It's a huge burrito, 1lb to be exact, and comes at a decent price of 6.99 with freshly fried tortilla chips and two salsas in the side (verde & chipotle).  I added grilled onions to it, even though I probably should've added peppers to bring it some more flair.  It was a good burrito, but I couldn't really tell there was vegan chorizo inside because of the abundance of tofu.  The seasoning was great, not too salty, and maybe the chorizo they use added to that flavor.  \n\nThe burrito had just the right amount of greasiness, reminiscent of a traditional Mexican burrito/taco stand. I would have loved more avocado in the burrito and salsa verde on the side. The chipotle salsa tasted watered down and didn't have much flavor, so I didn't bother using it.  I couldn't taste or tell there was sour cream or cheese in the burrito so that's a bit of a drawback.\n\nI'm giving 4 stars because overall it was a good burrito, I received my food very quickly and I had a good conversation with the owner about the establishment.",

The flavor is still very good though. The Lo Mein is quite good as well. The fried spring rolls that come with the lunch specials leave a little bit to be desired.

We also enjoyed the Caesar salad ) which is one of the best in the valley) lobster bisque, twice baked potato & their highly recommended vanilla butter cake; everything listed was fabulous and worth going back for. \n\nThe service at Ocean Club is impeccable! \n\nItems that disappointed were the overly greasy lobster mashed potatoes, lack luster chopped salad and dry chocolate layer cake; thus the 4 out of 5 stars.",

            "text": "Overrated, expensive, dull and slow is what comes to mind when I think of this restaurant.  A group of my friends visited Ocean Club tonight (a Sunday evening in early October at 6pm) for a friend's birthday.  I was very disappointed with the quality and flavor of the food and the service, which I would rate as terrible, especially for a fine dining establishment such as this.\n\nWhen you arrive it's clear that you're at a fine dining restaurant.  Dark rooms, fancy table settings, a well dressed wait staff.  It's too bad that our experience didn't match the ambiance.  In general everything just fell short--- beyond what you might expect at your typical over priced, stuffy steak house.\n\nI ordered the Scottish salmon blackened.  It was cooked correctly (rare) but lacked in flavor.  The presentation was terrible- a filet on a white plate and a small cup of what resembled an olive tappenade.  I would have asked our waiter but he was largely absent with the exception of when he walked us through the menu upon arrival which largely just confused the group. My husband ordered a salad and two types of oysters.  He requested that they both be served as a main course.  The salad arrived as an appetizer.  When the oysters arrived no one pointed out which oysters were which- they left him guessing.  We ordered wine and had wanted a second bottle. We eventually were able to order it but well after our entrees had arrived.\n\nIn general we wanted to have a relaxed dinner but service was so slow that there were points when I questioned if the staff even remembered that we were in the dining room.  We also had interesting interactions with our busser.  She first came to remove the bread from the table.  She asked us if we were done, to which my husband said \"you know what, just leave it and we'll pick at it throughout the meal.\" She smiled at him, looked at the table and took the bread.  It was clear she didn't understand him.  She mumbled for the rest of the evening and in general was incomprehensible.  I was really surprised.\n\nAll is all this place was disappointing. There's lots of competition for high end dining and perhaps I'm a snob but if you can't get the small stuff right then it's not worth the cost especially when the food is just mediocre.",

We started with the battered shrimp. The shrimps were huge! And the sauce that it came with was amazing. I got the crab legs which were so fresh and tasty, didn't even need butter. My husband got the blackened halibut and said it was great! For dessert we had their famous butter cake and it might have been the best dessert I have had in a very long time. I may have to make the trip up just to get a slice. I would definitely recommend coming here for any occasion and getting some really fresh and tasty food!",

I highly recommend the creamy ham, potato, and manchego croquetas and the grilled baby octopus. The paella was really good and had lots of seafood and meat along with crispy rice!

Lamb chops were fine, but for $6 a chop, I expect better than fine. To boot they brought the wrong drink and insisted it was what I ordered (notwithstanding the absence of cayenne pepper). \n\nDon't go. There are plenty of restaurants uptown with good food.",

Starbucks is known for it's quick service, and if they keep you waiting longer than 10 minutes in the drive-thru, they give you your drink for free--that is not the case at this location. I stop by daily because it's close to my work...and I wait a minimum of 7 minutes each time I go. (Yes, I time it.)\n\nPlease get more staff here. I am such a Starbucks fan that it's sad to see a location struggling.",

This was the easiest to find on my Starbucks app, plus I was probably on some type of \"star dash\" or some other incentive. \n\nThis was a pretty busy place, but my group commandeered a table and set about refreshing ourselves. At one point, those egg protein bites ended up at the table. They are actually pretty tasty and one of the better things to eat if you are in need of food.\n\nI vary when ordering at a Starbucks, depending on my need for calories--an Americano (0 calories), some exotic Reserve coffee from the a Clover (0 calories), a dark roast on drip, hoping that it's late enough in the day to have a pour-over instead (0 calories) or a latte (milk or almond milk) (some number greater than 0 calories). \n\nWi-Fi worked great for me, but I must confess my phone is probably set for permanent Starbucks Wi-Fi anywhere.

My sisters signature french toast looked outstanding and the hotcakes most of the group got as a side item smelled soooo good!\n\nI don't do any flour products so could not sample those to offer any feedback here sadly, sorry folks!

I would never come back here and I'm still thinking about the awful experience the next day. One star it is. \n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: I'm honestly pretty surprised by all of the high ratings. I was not a fan of this place and I think 2 stars is being generous.\n\nThe food was pretty disappointing and bland. I got the sirloin and eggs and my boyfriend got the Hawaiian melt. My steak was hardly seared and very bland, and nothing else on the plate seemed to be seasoned at all. But overall, my dish was much better than the Hawaiian melt. After one bite, my boyfriend said \"they should seriously consider taking this off the menu,\" and I would agree just from seeing it. Not only was the pineapple just in huge chunks which didn't seem to be the best way to do it, but the bread was literally soupy. Not just soggy; soupy. It was a pile of mush, even on the outside parts and at first glance I thought it was some sort of thick sauce that had dripped out of the sandwich onto the plate. When the waitress asked how everything was, he was nice but explained how soggy the sandwich was and the waitress got very defensive, saying that that was how the sandwich was supposed to be because the bread wasn't toasted and the melted cheese was what was causing it. I understand explaining, but to go on the defensive so quickly is not only unprofessional, but just plain rude. And also, who doesn't toast the bread for a melt?? If I were the waitress, a simple \"sorry about that, I'll have a word with the chefs\" would have been much better than her rude response.\n\nOverall, I was pretty disappointed even though I wasn't expecting too much. I wouldn't recommend this place and don't see it lasting long. There are much better diners out there.",

I saw the toast at last in the pick up window where it sat for what seemed to be quite some time. At last it was picked up and the server was half way to my table when she suddenly turned around, went back to pick up the coffee pot, and filled six or seven coffee warmups before delivering the toast. By that time my eggs and hash browns were cold. I paid my bill and still left a generous tip. I use a walker and as I was leaving, I had to ask three people to move their chairs as the tables were so close together. Poor service and lack of assess ability make Luke's a poor choice for me.",

Isn't the point of Pizza Hut that it is quicker then going to the local Harris Teeter & grabbing a take & bake pizza?  This location has now failed me 3x in delivering in excess of 60 mins each time it has been delivered online.  How is this allowed to happen?  This has soured me on Pizza Hut.

I asked how a $5 refund would cover the cost of a $9 pizza and was told that actually the toppings that were missing would only cost less than $2. I found this to be a completely unacceptable response and informed the restaurant I no longer wanted the replacement pizza because who knows what they would have done to my food. Pizza is a dime a dozen you would think there would be some form of customer appreciation but since not here so they won't be getting any other business from me.",

As I watch the employees and saw them get the orders of the other customers yet I was still waiting at the window for my order. When I finally got my order I checked in my bag and I didn't have any barbecue sauce as well as the banana was really old. I asked if they had another banana but they let me know that this was the only kind of bananas that they had even in the refrigerator in the back. I then asked the water and the cashier let me know that it did not come with the water but in the description on the menu it showed that it did have a water she double-checked and then she corrected herself and said it did have a water. So overall I'm not happy with the service and I'm not happy with the wait time. I think management really needs to come into play when teaching their employees how to serve customers because I don't think I'll ever go to that specific location again to order food because of this experience.",

Never ever have I been refused for a refund at any business in my whole entire life. Once we asked to speak to the owner that was supposedly there, we got a \"she doesn't handle customers response\" and \"she's going to tell you the same thing\". We then asked to speak to this so called owner that would be working there @11 pm at night and never saw them. I am very disappointed and disgusted in this business coming from a previous DQ employee. We then went to the one on Northern and they too made a mistake and they dod NOT hesitate to remake ours. They apologized nicely and did not mind remaking it like a GOOD RAN BUSINESS!! Take notes please cause this Dairy Queen needs a lot of work.",

Disappointed for $11, not worth it and Ill be avoiding this food truck.",

            "text": "So I was excited to try this truck since I love getting Satay at Kona Grill with fried rice. Maybe I should have not compared it Kona? I got the $9 meal option with Chicken & Pork, fried rice $1 extra and sliced hard cooked egg and vegetables (iceberg lettuce mostly) and added another chicken skewer for $3 for a total of $15 including $2 tip. Was it worth $13? No Ill give it 3 stars for the chicken and pork (almost too chewy) skewers only which were good but not amazing. The rice was so bland I had to dump the peanut and kecap manis sauces on it to give it flavor, very disappointed as this was my cheat day for carbs. The peanut sauce truly tastes homemade, which doesn't help flavoring the food. Too much iceberg lettuce for the name to be called vegetables since Iceberg lettuce is useless for any nutritional value. Im lucky we have many food trucks that come by in the area, if I were to this again Id only get the chicken and pork (if not too chewy) skewers",

            "text": "Tasty food, fast, and friendly service! Food truck owners work hard at balancing a fast paced kitchen in a very confined space all while maintaining their mobile restaurant. Satay Hut has proven to be exceptional in all of these areas. As you approach the truck you can see its stylish red, orange, and green paint scheme as a creative foreshadowing of the dedication that this crew puts into their food and service. You are greeted with friendly smiles from their chefs and intoxicating aromas from their culinary creations. \n\nI recently perused their menu during a Food Truck Friday at the Downtown Phoenix Public Market. They offer skewers of meats for a value price, as well as, meal options with many extras. I got their Satay Ayam meal. Included in the meal were two marinated chicken skewers with sides of steamed rice, fresh vegetables, sliced egg, atjar (sweet/spicey cucumbers), and their signature peanut butter sauce. Quite a refreshing lunch!\n\nFood truck owners need to cram as much business as they can into a couple of hours, typically during a lunch or dinner rush. They also focus on a couple of menu items that are unique to that truck. This usually makes the creative quality of food very high. Satay Hut has demonstrated this quality very well and I look forward to my next meal from this terrific truck!",

Did she forget she had customers at her window?  Who knows.  We decide to order from another truck.  However, after we're informed that it will take 30+ minutes to get our food from the other truck, I got back in line for Satay Hut.  \n\nThough having your order taken even when you're at the window takes a while, I must say that you do get your order pretty quickly.  \n\nWe got a pork and a beef skewer.  The beef was tough, dry, and definitely overcooked.  Seriously a good thing I have all of my teeth.  I didn't bother giving any to Baby C.  The pork was not as tough, BUT it was extremely fatty.  And the peanut sauce was nothing to write home about - probably peanut butter with some type of chili sauce mixed in.  Really overpowering.  \n\nAt $3.50 a pop - I doubt we'll be getting satay from here again.",

What a nice change in cuisine too (and healthier!) from past visitors.\n\nI did the build your own meal with the beef and chicken skewers, white rice, and veggies.  The beef was slightly tough but both beef and chicken were absolutely delicious.  The peanut sauce was advertised as spicy and it wasn't at all.  I was actually relieved as I don't like spicy food but can tolerate it more now than in the past.  The peanut sauce had a nice rich peanut flavor and complimented the meat well.\n\nSadly, I did not like the little container of pickled veggies that came with my meal.  It was way too vinegar-y for me.  Everything else was finished though!\n\nI hope they come back soon so I can try out the 2 other skewers I missed out on - the pork and tofu.  Thank you for the delicious lunch!",

My broccoli tasted moldy...I thought it was just one floret, but the next one was so much worse I could not eat it, I had to use my napkin to dispose of it from my mouth. The other broccoli piece had a brown tinge to it, so I just avoided it in fear of experiencing that moldy flavor again. The rest of the bowl tasted fine and I thought okay maybe it is just a one off on the broccoli thing, and I continue on to the rest of the bowl. Then a minute later I take a bite and craaaccckk there is something hard and definitely not edible in my food apparently. I locate the item and it looks like a black jagged rock of some sort. I go to a worker and let them know what I found in my food and show her the small black piece that I bit down on (I was not expecting anything, ai just wanted to give them a heads up) her response was \"Oh, it must have been from the handle of one of our knives, that happens sometimes. Sorry.\" UM what!?! Get some better knives then that don't fall apart into people's food!!!!! I really wanted to like this place and am disappointed...on top of that my tooth still hurts from biting down on whatever that thing was.

Myself and two other customers were standing outside knocking because according to the website and googles hours of operations the store was not supposed to close until 9:30. The girls just looked at us and shrugged their shoulders as we stood there. \n\nNeedless to say we were disappointed and the store was missing business.",

            "text": "Just as quickly as the cupcake craze has taken off, so has the frozen yogurt industry!  I mean, what ever happened to good old TCBY?  I know they are still hanging on by a thread but good grief!  They certainly have major competition!  Now there is Yoforia, Tasty-yo, Pinkberry, etc.  \n\nI support the overall idea and I love the places that allow you to put on your own toppings.  It is much more comfortable to just load up your own cup as opposed to saying to the employee \"can you add a few more chunks of chocolate and would you mind saturating my yogurt with the hot fudge?  Great, thank you.\"\n\n\nSweet Frog is one of those places that allows you to \"load your own\" and I must say, the toppings always look fresh and plentiful!  But let's talk about the yogurt first...\n\nThey may not have as many flavors as Yoforia but what they do offer is always VERY good.  It is super creamy and the flavors individually make a statement!  I don't know if anyone else has experienced this but when I put three or so flavors in my cup, they usually all start to blend together.  It just all tasted like vanilla or sugar ice.  But these flavors are so distinct and sooo full of flavor!  They have their \"standard\" flavors that are all good--Cookies and Cream, Strawberry banana, Cake Batter, Vanilla, Peanut Butter, etc.  But, their seasonal flavors this year have been FABULOUS!  I tried their pumpkin and their apple pie flavors and they were divine.  It literally tasted like pie!  You can pick your size and mix as many flavors as you wish or they give you the \"swirl\" option on each machine.  The only thing that wigs me out about the froyo spots is where it says \"live cultures.\"  I know that is supposed to be a good thing but for some reason it doesn't exactly help my appetite when I read that before loading up.  That's just me though!  I also like the fact that this place has a good old fashioned vanilla.  It isn't tart, greek, sour or whatever else...just old school McDonald's cone vanilla style!\n\nNext stop--the toppings!  They are great--all types of candy (chocolaty or sugary), wafers, coconut, chocolate chips, fruit, nuts, etc.  Then they have amazing sauces--Marshmallow cream, caramel, hot fudge, peanut butter (my favorite), honey, etc.  So good!  You have all you need to make a perfect treat.  You can make it as healthy or as unhealthy as you prefer.\n\nDefinitely a great alternative to the typical \"go-to\" yogurt spot, yoforia.",

Consequently, the variety of plates on the conveyor at any one time was relatively limited.\nThe seating was also a bit tight compared to other sushi restaurants we've visited.\nThis location would probably be fine as a Boba tea shop or a caf\u00e9, however we felt it was too small for sitting down for sushi.\nAlthough the staff were clearly making their best effort to take care of all the customers, they still seemed a little short staffed.\n\nVerdict:\nHaving a conveyor belt sushi restaurant in this plaza is a great idea.\nHowever, we thought the space was too small to pull it off successfully.\nStill, we were willing to award 3 stars for the effort made by the staff to accommodate their customers",

The fish is very low quality, we ordered yellowtail sashimi and it literally tasted like dirty water. Which is not how is supposed to taste. We probably won't be back, but it was a fun experience. We ordered a baked scallop roll (which of course they don't offer on the belt) it was $2.50 for 4 pieces and it was DELICIOUS. So if you do decide to go here, I highly recommend ordering that!

We asked to be reseated and fortunately the place was mostly empty so we were.  The new table was an improvement -- until the kitchen revved up.  Then the place became far smokier (and oilier) than any restaurant ought to be.\n\nFood.  Mediocre at best.  The maitre d' (who doubled as a waiter) warned us that the food was very spicy-- 1 to 10 \"and that's Thai 1 to 10, not American.\"  So I ordered a 1.  Completely tasteless.  \n\nService.  The maitre d' was a clown and a compulsive talker.  If the atmosphere and the food hadn't already spoiled the dinner, he most certainly would have.\n\nConsidering how many Thai restaurants there are (some of which are within a stone's throw of this place) and some of which are pretty good or even excellent, this place is so low on the list that it's not worth patronizing.

I placed my order 30minutes in advance and arrived about 10 minutes early. The lady let me know that my food wasn't quite ready and let me sit down. She was very friendly. I only sat for a few minutes before my food was up, still before the estimated time they quoted me. \nI ordered chicken pad thai. I usually like my thai food to have a little bit of a kick to it. Unfortunately, this does not have much of any kick, but next time I will remember to ask if it's possible to make it spicier. Other than that, it's very typical pad thai, no complaints. Since I ordered it as take out, all of the toppings were on top of the noodles, so make sure to mix them in so you don't eat all of the chicken/ peanuts/ etc and get stuck with just noodles. \nTrue to the other reviews, the portion size is HUGE. This will certainly be at least one if not two more meals for later. Considering it cost me $12, that's a great bang for your buck. \nOverall, I probably will come back and since their menu is so extensive, I'm sure to find something I'll fall in love with.",

I thought that the name noodle outlet would probably be out of reach for me since I can't  eat gluten. I was really happy to find out that they have so many gluten-free options and were really knowledgeable when I asked about different items.  The waiter, Launthar, was great.  If he didn't know the answers he asked the chef. Plus he had a great smile and energy.  I ordered the Pad-See-Ew with shrimp and fresh roll. The two fresh rolls were delicious and the waiter provided me with a gluten-free sauce. The noodle dish with shrimp was very delicious as well. I will definitely be back when I'm around this area again.",

The Som Tum really did taste like I was having it out of a street outlet in a Thai night market.  Yen Ta Fo was fragrant and brimmed with many different types of proteins and veggies.  There were some exotic ingredients too like cow liver and tripe, as far as I can tell, which IMO added to the flavor and texture but if you are not into those I guess you can ask them to be taken out.  More common selections like Pad Thai and Pad See-Ew are also very good, although the Pad Thai is a little bit on the sweeter side.  Personally liked the Pad See-Ew better.  Perfect balance and flat rice noodles were springy (not mushy) like they should be.  Some day I'll sit down here.  There is an interesting gentleman from the UK manning the tables who has promised to tell me a story once I do.",

The entrees however were outstanding. The green curry was delicious (my favorite green curry is pusadee's garden) and this was a little better. Definitely far better than Bangkok balcony's. The vegetables were nice and crispy and the biggest surprise was the beef, really tasty and good quality. Same to be said for beef with broccoli. Can't wait to try all the other dishes here, this will be my go-to Thai place to pick up.",

            "text": "Hubby and I went this afternoon . . primarily because it's close to home, and we wanted to see how they had revamped this restaurant since its previous incarnation, The Pour House.  We had heard they serve fried mac & cheese, which really piqued our interest!  However, we were VERY disappointed to sample it.  It was creamy mac & cheese coated in thick breading and deep fried.  I had hoped for a more substantial, homemade mac & cheese that, once cooked & cooled, can be sliced and pan fried alone, not with heavy breading.   This option is a LOT cleaner, and probably cheaper to produce/serve.\nWe also ordered Lobster Potato Skins and a Reuben.  Lobster Potato Skins . . are you kidding?  Who could resist this?  And, they were really, really great bar fare with beer.  The Reuben was a fantastic grilled sandwich made with bread that is baked at a local bread bakery (Breadsmith), great pastrami, sauerkraut, and melted cheese.\nOur waitress, Casey, was friendly, attentive and offered much valuable information about the menu and chef.\nOverall, the visit exceeded our expectations, and we will return.  But, please guys, work on the fried mac & cheese!  This could be your signature appetizer!  As it is, it tastes like it came out of a box . . . out of the freezer.",

            "text": "I hate to do it, but last night was pretty bad bordering on awful.  There were five of us for dinner at about 5:30pm, so it was not crowded.  And it was Tuesday night.\n\nGot our beverage orders in and then waitress came for our orders.  Two ordered all-you-can-eat wings, one grilled talapia, one Carolina burger (loaded with stuff), one Ruben sandwich and I the hamburger steak.\n\nMeals came, but not mine.  Could not get the attention of the waitress at all and she did not come by to check on us.  Finally one of the guys stood up waving his arms and she arrived.  I started to ask and she said, \"They (the kitchen) forgot.\"  I asked if they were cooking my order because if they were not I would have ordered something quick.  No luck, they were cooking my meal.\n\nIt took quite awhile judging by the wing eaters were down to two wings each, the Ruben half gone, fish finished and the burger nearly done.\n\nMy order arrived.  Wish it hadn't.  The hamburger steak was one and a half hamburger paddies with one just tagged into the edge of another.  It was evident that the kitchen rushed to get \"something\" out.\n\nThe meat was about medium, OK.  The brown gravy must have been out of a can and was so salty that I scraped it off.  The supposed grilled onions and mushrooms consisted of barely cooked, really raw onion pieces and two slices of a mushroom.\n\nThe fries which I ordered in lieu of the baked potato were so salty that I could not eat them until I wiped them off and even then they were too salty.  And the slice of toast was almost dripping from the oily spread saturating it from top and bottom.\n\nThe Ruben eater only ate half of his sandwich as his grilled bread was also soaked as to be inedible.  The talapia was good and the guys raved about the wings, though they would not share to try, but they looked crisp and well fried.\n\nSo much for the all you could eat deal on the wings.  The original plate was 10 wings and successive plates would contain 5 wings.  Since the waitress never returned and they could not get her attention, all they ate was the initial plate.  They were not happy, especially because they really liked the wings.\n\nThe waitress did not charge me for the meal.  A decent acknowledgement and apology.  It was fair.\n\nSo where are we?  I have been with Brew's from the beginning.  I am so proud of the effort the new owner has put into a total kitchen renovation, residing and re-roofing and the special he is running.  Way to go with a place that has had probably six owners over less than that many years. I so much want him to succeed and he is a great guy to talk with.\n\nHe also has given the new Indian Land VFW the use of Brew's on Saturdays prior to opening.  A fine man.\n\nHow sad that after all that work, risk and investment he is let down by an inattentive waitress and a less that satisfactory kitchen crew.  Time for some serious boot placements on many people's forth point of contact.  Airborne and other parachutists will understand just where on the human anatomy that is.\n\nSorry for the two star, but come on...you have the potential to be a solid 4 or 5 star business.  You can do better, so do it.",

And when I ate their food I didn't have to spend the rest of the day in the bathroom, so they also listened and didn't put any of my allergens in the food. \n\nThat said, the food was really pretty nasty. A lot of the people in our group took a few bites, and then went and got food from starbucks for lunch instead. It also had so much MSG in it that we all felt really bad afterwards. I'm pretty sensitive and it makes me super tired, which isn't fun when you're presenting all afternoon!",

I don't like junk, and a couple of my other favorite Chinese places to eat, here in town, are Cathay House (Chinatown, not Palms Casino) and Orchid Garden (Sahara). The other reviewers on this site that said this place has flavorless food need to have their tastebuds checked. Probably smokers. I love this place for what it is! Try the Triple Delight, Hong Kong Pan Fried Noodles, Dragon & Phoenix, Wor Won Ton Soup and/or Shrimp with Snow Peas just to name a few. I would recommend this place as a step up from Panda, easily, but maybe not quite of the same caliber as the other two I mentioned as those others are full blown sit-down Chinese restaurants with dim sum carts, etc. and more menu options.",

Location was what made me choose this place,it's right off the freeway as I headed back to Phoenix.What I didn't do was check the rating/reviews. The man who took my order was extremely friendly and the place was pretty clean that's why I gave 2 stars. The food however, was disappointing. Everything was hot and fresh, but flavor was either off or lacking. I ordered the lunch chicken lo mein and my husband got the lunch Mongolian beef. His was ok, just ok nothing more. It seemed like a small portion in my opinion. My lo mein was pretty flavorless almost like spaghetti without sauce. I also ordered a hot and sour soup (they only offer 1 size & it's almost $5) and it was weird. Not really hot or sour but almost tasted like toast. The only good I can say about the soup is at least it had some substance to it and it wasn't all watery and thin. I love a good hot & sour soup and this was far from what I'd call good. Probably for the first time ever, I would have rather had Panda Express. I even passed one in boulder city and wished I would've waited. Bottom line, I wasted 18 bucks.",

The fried rice had no flavor to it and was drowning in chopped onions.\n\nMaybe I'm just being harsh because there used to be a Yummy Grill next door but this doesn't hit the spot like other Chinese restaurants in the Henderson area.",

The Tavern allowed my friends to bring in macarons and cake to celebrate, and provided veggie and fruit trays, and the best gourmet pizza! \n\nThe speakeasy is entirely legit, and the furniture and decor is marvelous.

The building itself looks a little run down from the outside and the entry way is dusty with a worn carpet and odd nic-naks decorating the area.  The inside shares the \"unique\" interior decorating quirks; a bicycle on the wall, multiple randomly placed signs and some mis matched chairs decorate the large seating area.  Likewise, there's some cleanliness issues on the ceiling fans and light fixtures.\n\nBUT, the reason I go to a restaurant is the food and service.  Both were a hit.  Our waitress served us quickly, had both orders dead on and offered and supplied everything  could ask for.  One quirk that the Tavern may want to keep an eye on is the Tabasco bottle I asked for and received did not have the usual pour spout most standard bottles have; it had been removed.  As a result, my initial dash of Tabasco resulted in a full tablespoon or more.  Fortunately, I like hot food so I soldiered on; however, many diners may ruin their food without first checking the bottle first.\n\nI had a standard fare side salad with the house dressing and blue cheese crumbles.  Fresh, crisp vegetables and enough carrots, tomatoes, and cucumber to be a real salad, not a bed of greens.  The star of my lunch was the Crab cake in my crab cake sandwich.  The aioli and roll were fine but the cake had a great consistency and a good char on the outside.  Great flavor from a grilled crab cake; not something you can get many places in the area.  If there's anything I would change is a touch more \"bite\" or seasoning on the cake or aioli itself.  The taste was good but somewhat bland until the dose of Tabasco.   \n\nOverall no real complaints; I highly recommend it for lunch and would love to try dinner with my family sometime.",

Ribeye and filet are charged extra $3 (on the menu, no surprise), which is rather expensive for steaks that don't compare to Flemmings or Stockyard.  The appetizers were great, the side dishes were great.  The steak was cooked as ordered.  The service was awful.  Our server did not serve the wine, so when we asked for it as we were eating the appetizer, she said, \"Oh, I thought you would like it with your meal.\"  I think she should have asked and taken responsibility for her error.  She never apologized.  She also did not serve us promptly.  Checked on us once.  We did not get our bill for about 20 minutes after we finished.   It was wrong, so we asked her to fix it, and it took her five to ten minutes to bring it back.  She never came to pick it up, so after about another fifteen minutes, we paid with cash and left it on the table.",

We ordered the Loaded potato skins for our appetizer and when they came we still had not recieved our bread so I asked as she was bringing the appetizer she said it was not ready yet and walked away then I look down at the potato skins and  they were extremely burnt and hard as a rock. Not even a minute later waitress comes by and quickly sets bread down and walks away. Then the manager comes to the table behind us and the lady at the table was complaining that she received shrimp instead of prawns and wanted the meal for free. The manager was trying to talk her into a $1 discount and a remake(can you believe? a frickin dollar) The lady became louder and louder and started cussing because the manager was not bending so this went on for 10 minutes and she starts dropping F bombs. BOOM free meal. So we were subjected to this obnoxious convo for 10 minutes just so he could give her what she asked for all along. Then our meals came. Steak was excellent but onion rings like the appetizer were burnt to a crisp. I do not like confrontation and after seeing what the lady behind me had to do to get action I paid the bill and left. The next day I filed a complaint on their website and within a hour that store manager called apologizing profusely and saying I should have brought it to their immediate attention. So she ends the convo by asking me \"did she address my concerns and could she do anything to make me come back... I could not believe she was going to put it on me to ask for a discounted or free meal instead of saying, \"this is what I'm going to do for this horrible experience\" NO, I have to tell her what to do. so I said nothing because I figured the other lady wanted free and was offered $1 off if they said that to me I would end up cussing her out. It should not be up to me to tell her how I want it resolved. From now on I will go to Longhorn.",

I was right because it ended up being 50 minutes. Crazy! And shortly before we were called, a giant party of like 20-25 people got called back. It looked like a busload of people flooding in. So weird. After we were seated, we decided on the Campfire Feast since we had a coupon for $42.\nWe ordered potato skins for the appetizer and they brought out the tasty bread. For my meal I selected the Fire Grilled Chicken with a side of teriyaki sauce, garlic mashed potatoes, and grilled asparagus. The potato skins were yummy and we ended up taking half of them home. When our server brought our food out, she told us she just learned that they were out of the bacon mac & cheese my boyfriend ordered. She said it would be 8 minutes and he said he would wait. Shortly after, the manager came over and said they wouldn't have any more mac & cheese tonight and offered another side. He settled for onion rings.\nMy chicken was fine, the mashed taters were ok, a little dry, and the asparagus were alright. The green beans my boyfriend had were delicious! They have bacon and whatever seasoning they use is awesome. The onion rings were also great. Super fresh and hot. Mmmm! We were quite full but we still had dessert to eat. We decided on the New York Style Cheesecake. It was great! It seemed to have a lemon flavor and had the strawberry daiquiri sauce on top. So some good things, some not so good. Still not ever worth a 50 minute wait. I guess we will make a reservation next time.",

            "text": "It had been awhile since we'd been to a Black Angus Steakhouse.  They seem to be few and far between theses days.  Once you could find them in just about every state, but now they are pretty much confined to the Western part of the U.S.\n\nThis location in Goodyear, AZ was close to our hotel so we decided to give it a try.  The decor of the steakhouse is done in a western motif.  All the art on the walls is of horses, cowboys, and ranchers.  Some photos, but mostly prints.\n  The booths have a high back to them for privacy I guess---they were upholstered in a colorful blue printed fabric which fit in with the whole Southwestern feel to the place.\n\nThe menu has changed a lot from what I remembered.  It's divided into appetizers, main courses which consist of mainly steaks and ribs.  There is also a section where you may choose a dining for two option, which is what we did.  It consists of a choice of appetizer to share, two entrees, and a dessert.  Two sides come with the meals.  We chose a shrimp cocktail---the traditional cooked, chilled jumbo shrimp with a spicy cocktail sauce.  My husband and I both had a 5 oz. filet.  I had a baked potato with green beans done in a bacon sauce.  Our son also chose a filet, salad, and baked potato.   The steaks were all done to our liking---nicely cooked to order, good flavors and not overly seasoned. Dessert was a peach/cherry cobbler to share.  A very nice end to the meal.\n\nI'm happy that Black Angus still exists because it's a great way to enjoy a good steak without paying steakhouse prices!",

They are not a franchise so I don't assume they have an SOP. But in this location their food is always really good and authentic. They are super nice and again their food is always fresh and delicious.\nAnother good thing about them is that they are English and Chinese fluent so if there is something that I want they can always customize. I would give 5 stars but their location cannot hold more than 20 people and their deliver is a bit slow. But I don't blame them they are always busy:)",

            "text": "A statewide high school sports event at Camp Randall keeps Regent Street fairly busy and I park on a side street walking a few blocks to Indie Coffee through a neighborhood of vintage apartments and student housing, grade school, church, hospital.\n\nWhat was Indie Coffee before it was Indie Coffee? The narrow vestibule-type entrance, trapping cold air, is the initial sign of consideration for patron's comfort. A mantelpiece over a once-upon-a-time hearth, whitewashed and easy to miss, draws my curiosity set as it is in the front of the deep and high-ceilinged coffee house. There's the overall feeling in the place that is welcoming, fulfilling a hospitable mission bred in its bones. Even though I sit just feet from Regent Street the surroundings lend cozy comfort--it's always the little touches, like the small lamp on my table, the natural light from the tall north-facing windows, that bring me all the way in, settled.\n\nMy mission is a continued search for the good, better and best hot chocolate in town. A smiling and attentive woman at the counter takes and affirms my order for the Monona (16 oz.) Hot Chocolate ($3.00) with whipped cream ($0.25) and a Buttermilk Waffle ($5.25). The Monona, made with Ghirardelli chocolate, is warm all the way through and rich and delicious to the last drop. It's one of the best and I am happy to have found my way to Indie Coffee today. The buttermilk waffle is reason to return again and again.\n\nA bottle of Jameson catches my eye, set back on a shelf behind the counter alongside the coffees. When I ask, the staff tell me it's usually ordered up as shots on game days. But they do make an Irish Coffee. Which gives me my next mission: the good, better and best Irish Coffee in town, and I'll start with Indie Coffee's version.",

In the summer, you can sit on their back patio (so cute) and sip an iced chi. They also have live bands on some nights.\n\nThe baristas are nice and down to earth. They also work really hard because it's usually one person during the afternoons and evenings who has to serve both coffee and food. The food is not cheap. I've bought a few small bakery items made locally, but not much else.\n\nA major downside is that the hours aren't great for students who need to study late. I lived near the coffee shop for two years and my roommate and I would say \"let's go study at Indie,\" and then would realize it would close soon after we got there.",

We ordered a chocolate chocolate chip waffle, a salami focaccia, a chicken focaccia and a classic mocha. The focaccias were amazing. The salami one had spinach that was blanched, so not raw, although I don't mind raw. That was interesting. I think I would prefer raw although I know some people don't like it raw. But I didn't like the cold wetness of it. But the sandwich was still amazing. The waffle, of course, was perfect. Can't really ruin a waffle. And the chicken focaccia was tasty, which I was surprised by since chicken breast can be tasteless and dry. Overall, a great pick.",

When I got them from this place I opened the box and it was half full with very little meat. Every other shop Ive been to loads up the thing which is how it should be seeing as though I pay for extra meat. When I asked if he could fix it he was very rude and said \"that is extra meat just less fries\". I thought to myself.. I never asked for less fries I asked for more meat and payed extra for it. So since the guy was being a jerk I just said I wanted a refund and went to a different Robertos which of course definitely did load up the fries as normal. This is one of the worst Robertos I have ever been to. I definitely would not recommend going here especially if you want some good carne asada fries. Everything they make is skimpy and lazily thrown together and the guys there are very rude.",

When I realized it was the fries, I waited for someone to come back to the window with no luck. So I parked and went inside to get it fixed. I stood at the counter for a couple minutes before someone decided to finally come to the counter to help me. On top of already waiting far too long to be assisted, the lady that helped me was so unbelievably rude to me. I told her the situation and from the get go, she started arguing with me telling me that I ordered the fries. I have never ordered the carne asade fries in my life and was actually ordering for a co-worker straight from the order she wrote down for me. So I KNOW I ordered the quesadilla. The lady kept blaming me and telling me it was my fault. At this point, I was furious but didn't want to cause a scene. So I stood there quietly while they made the quesadilla and decided to check the prices of both items and noticed the fries are more expensive than the quesadilla. Typically, I am the type of person to just shrug it off and not worry about the price difference. However, when she handed me the food with attitude and immediately walked away without offering any type of compensation for the price difference, I decided I had enough of being treated like crap and wanted my money back.  As she was walking away, I had to grab her attention again and she was NOT pleased. I explained to her the price difference and immediately she threw her hands in the air and said again \"it's not my fault you said fries\". I was so baffled that someone would treat a customer so badly no matter whose fault it was that the order was wrong. No matter who is at fault, I came in here calmly to get the issue fixed. I did not deserve to be treated the way she was treating me.  She then said something to one of her co-workers (which she had likely been talking badly about me the whole time- too bad I don't understand Spanish). He told her the price difference between the items and she opened the register and basically threw a dollar at me and said \"Here\". Mind you, the price difference is $1.15 and I was charged the tax on the more expensive item. Again, I normally blow this kind of thing off especially because it really wasn't a big price difference. However, no customer should EVER be treated the way I was treated no matter who was at fault for the order being wrong. At this point, I only wish I would have made a bigger scene and demanded a full refund and ate somewhere else.",

            "text": "This is my first ever yelp review, so bear with me! With that said, please take note of the fact that I decided to finally take the plunge and write a review because of this restaurant! \n\nIt is worth mentioning that they are under new management as of about 4 months ago and from my understanding, have made many significant changes. \n\nLet's start with the service. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful during my visit. They were attentive and very knowledgeable on all of the menu offerings. The way the staff speaks about their food and the dishes is actually inspiring. Explanations were heavily detail orientated and the passion they have for what they do truly shines through.\n\nThe space itself is beautifully done from the moment you walk in the door; The restaurant decor, artwork to the table setup. Everything in the restaurant was in great condition and very clean. We came for lunch, unknowingly, while their lunch buffet was occurring. Multiple times during my visit I watched as the employees checked on the buffet, ensuring it was clean, trays were full and food was hot! \n\nAnd for the grand finale, the food!!! You guys, I was not just pleasantly surprised, I was blown away! As was everyone I came with. We opted for an array of a la cart menu items (some of which are offered at the buffet, as well). Again I'm going to talk about detail. The detail and care they put into the ingredients and dishes is incredible. \n\nWe were told the mango greens salad was a top seller so we opted for that. It was so fresh, perfectly dressed, and a wonderful combination of ingredients. The Szechwan dumplings (we had the chicken) were simple, yet so flavorful and made in house! The jalape\u00f1o fish was breaded to perfection and cooked just right. \n\nAs for entrees, the volcano shrimp was delicious!! It can be difficult to find good seafood in the valley, but rest assured, you won't have that issue here. The 5 spice lamb...wow! So tender and perfectly seasoned. The classic Mongolian beef dish did not disappoint. \n\nWe also ordered the burnt garlic chili rice and the Hakka noodles. The rice!! Oh the rice. It was beyond delicious and certainly packed a punch. The Hakka noodles were the perfect addition to balance out some of our more spicy dishes. We were also informed that the noodles for this dish are specially made in Vietnam, specifically for this dish. How cool is that? I can honestly say that I would happily order ever single dish I tried, again and again. \n\nWe ended our meal with the date wontons with ice cream. This is easily the most creative and interesting dessert I have ever had. The dates, to my surprise, paired so well in the fried wonton with the ice cream. The ice cream was served warm and was used for dipping. It was so good!! I am still in awe at how well this flavor combination worked together to create this dish. It is worth mentioning that the presentation and plating of each dish was so unique and beautifully done. \n\nThe overall experience at Inchin Bamboo Garden was incomparable and I cannot wait to go back to this hidden gem.",

            "text": "Having had Chinese food in India while growing up, we went with a lot of anticipation. Amongst the ten of us, we ordered some twelve dishes, including hakka chicken and shrimp, chicken 65, chili garlic noodles with chicken, garlic pepper chicken and shrimp chop suey.\n\nThe Chicken 65 was very good, with slightly tangy pieces of boneless chicken that had a crunch on first bite, garnished with red and green bell peppers. The chili garlic noodles were tasty, but we initially thought there was a mistake with our order since we could not see any chicken in it.  On close inspection, we noticed a few miniscule pieces of chicken... The shrimp chop suey was about average, although the few shrimp were rather small. The garlic pepper chicken was neither garlicky nor peppery, instead swimming in a pool of watery gravy. But the biggest disappointment was the hakka dishes, which are a signature Indo-Chinese noodle dish.  These were completely bland, and we had to resort to adding more than a few dollops of the 6 sauces at the table to pretend we were having Indo-Chinese cuisine.\n\nWe wished the portions were more generous, like we get at most Chinese restaurants. We had to order a couple of extra entrees since some of us were still hungry, whereas we almost never can finish our food at other restaurants.\n\nThe service was competent bordering on perfunctory. One of us was curious about Nasi Goreng on the menu, but our server could not describe how it was prepared, instead steering us to a couple of other choices on the menu.\n\nOur receipt invited us to share our experience at a \"Talk2us\" link, which only produced a \"survey error.\"\n\nHaving had great Indo-Chinese food in Calcutta, Vancouver and Houston, we are still waiting for a comparable experience in the Phoenix area.",

            "text": "Service is absolutely horrible!!! I can't emphasize that enough. Like many Indian restaurants, the restaurant has lousy service and appears understaffed in my opinion. There was no hostess. We waited 10 minutes before anyone greeted us.  Once we were seated, no one greeted us and just kept passing by us. Yeah, I mean no one took our drink order. Finally, we had to flag a waiter and yell at them that no one even approached our table. Only then did they stop to even take an order. The water at the tables is lukewarm. The bottle they are in appeared dirty. For as nice as the restaurant appeared in terms of decor, they really should invest in a hostess and about 3 more waiters and teach them basic service etiquette.\n\nThe food is decent in my opinion. It's good but nothing noteworthy. I've had better Indian Chinese in other parts of the Valley. If the service was better, I would have considered back here. But with the lousy service, I don't recommend dining here. If you are go to dine, I recommend a few things. Bring bottles of cold water. Based on my experience, I think there is a good chance your water and drinks will not be refilled. Our water was never refilled, not once!! Also any drink they bring you will be served lukewarm. Asking for ice was like asking for gold; it's a rare commodity here in my opinion and when they brought ice in drinks, there was hardly any in the glass. Dress lightly and bring some hand held fans. The restaurant was very warm and the ventilation was poor imho. This was winter, I hate to imagine what it's like in the summer here. Arrive here with the mentality that you are in Russia circa 1980's. Expect long waits! Maybe have a few alcoholic drinks prior to arriving here to mellow you out cuz you will be frustrated.",

I generally do not like their standardized coffee and just go in for fraps (the sweetness makes the coffee bearable), but I know that there is something comforting about getting the same coffee wherever you are in the country.\n\nWhat makes me want to write about this Starbucks, though, is the incredibly friendly service we received on our visit here. My cousin has a propensity for ordering from the secret menu without regard to just how much trouble it would cause the barista or how it could affect the line. On this visit, my cousin researched the recipe for the secret frappuccino menu she wanted* and the barista was incredibly patient with her. That was pretty impressive.\n\nIf you are in want of alright coffee with great customer service, this Starbucks is where you should go to.\n\n\n*For those of you who are not aware, the baristas would only make the secret menu item if you know the exact recipe for it. Giving them a name of the secret menu thing is not enough.",

Chips & salsa, chips & queso, traditional tacos, shredded beef empanadas, reina pepiada, chido burrito and churros (to go!---so full) My favorite was the shredded beef empanadas.

Delivery time was reasonable and food arrived still warm.  Overall I definitely recommend this place and will be ordering again!  Prices are a bit high but the food was very filling and I had a couple days worth of leftovers.",

When I received it, the beans were spilling out of the arepa and the cornmeal which could've been a little more crispy, was soggy. The flavors were present and the arepa was generously filled.

We can't wait to try more in the future, it just hard not to always order our favorites.

We sit down and within two minutes the waitress comes over and asks for our order. Without having time to look at the menu we asked for her to come back in a few minutes. 20 minutes later and empty drinks the waitress took our order. I asked for a side of vegetables and was told they only make enough to serve with the special. I thought this comment was odd because every time I have eaten there and requested them I was not given this answer. We place our order. Didn't ask if we wanted another drink or more water. A few minutes later another staff member came over and quickly got us another drink. The appetizer was brought out with the meals and did not have the extra side of sauce as requested. Finally my salad came with NO dressing. 10 minutes later the waitress appeared with the dressing and side sauce for the appetizer which was extremely cold now. Before she could run away again we asked to order another drink.\nOverall I was disappointed and shocked on how bad the service was. It was enough to make me not want to go back. Rude and untimely waitress on a TUESDAY! Can you imagine how it would be on a Friday or Saturday. Apparently you get better service at the bar so if you go sit there.",

            "text": "This was our second choice, arriving here after being told of a 40-minute wait at nearby Primanti Brothers in Mount Lebanon.  We should have stayed there.  We had a more than 30 minute wait at Armstrong's on a weekday night when everyone was apparently enjoying being off from work and school: lots of large parties.  None of the young lady hosts go out of their way to be cordial or welcoming and there is no management in evidence: what a difference it would make if a pleasant individual in charge of the dining room would come over to briefly chat and to assure that the meal was satisfactory.  Our server was delightful: full of personality, charm, and pizzazz.  She did not bring water or bread nor ask us if we wanted either.  I received a glass of water upon request.  I ordered the stuffed chicken breast special.  I should have been tipped off by the reasonable price of $10.50 for the complete dinner that it would not be very substantial, and it was, in fact, the tiniest chicken breast imaginable.  The chicken was mediocre and bland.  Calling this stuffed chicken breast was inaccurate.  The breast was so tiny and flat that it could not have been stuffed with anything.  It was, in fact, chicken breast topped with stuffing.  The stuffing was delicious, including mushrooms, carrots, and zucchini.  The accompanying mashed potatoes and gravy were also very good.  I substituted a side order of french fries for the broccoli that comes with the meal, no additional charge.  The fries were golden brown and tasty, and the portion huge.  I asked for a cup of the soup du jour, cream of mushroom.  I was brought a large bowl.  It was excellent, but not served hot.   The price was a whopping $5.25, which gives me pause as I reflect upon the fact that a large serving of soup is included at an outstanding favorite restaurant of ours, Franco's Trattoria in Peters Township.  My significant other ordered an Italian hoagie: enormous and delicious, filled with a layer of tasty cheese, but pricey at $14.50, which included no side dish or salad.  The tab came to $51 with two draft beers, a generous tip, and with no dessert.  I believe Armstrong's has gotten ahead of itself in boosting prices.  It is comparable in many ways to another nearby neighborhood gem, Pasta Too, but it is significantly more expensive.",

And if you are ever feeling the desire to go all out, do not hesitate to indulge on one of their amazing desserts! I recently ordered the Heath bar cheesecake and it was amazing- smooth, delicious and full of chocolate and butter toffee flavor. By far, the best cheesecake I've had- better than Cheesecake Factory and much cheaper! The ambiance is great. It's dim indoors usually, unless the sun is shining through the ceiling window.

Rudest employee ever, she needs to check herself and realize she is a front desk girl at a club, in a casino, in Arizona. This isn't Vegas sweetie, or L.A.

I don't care if it was packed like a sardine can if that was the case she should have politely explained they were at capacity, (although the waiting area was EMPTY no lines or people waiting and the club was supposed to be open almost a whole hour still.)

People started leaving in the beginning and went down to the casino level where there was a lounge playing live music and a DJ. As for the bartenders they were terrible. Took them FOREVER to get the drinks ready for people and I heard one of the females were rude. The manager needs to make sure they are attending to the whole bar section and not just one side. Will I go back again only if the first DJ was there and then I would leave when he did.",

It's on the 14th Floor of the casino and the view is amazing.  \n\nHere's my thought: I wish this place would be more popular for the younger crowd. My friends I'm not getting any younger myself, but if I'm a club promoter I can't say Degree 270 would be my first choice.  The music is hip and actually very good. Drinks are affordable and plus you have a swanky restaurant upstairs and a casino downstairs - right? Right? Well again the crowd needs to change.  In the end, it's about whose who and why they should go.  I would come to lounge and enjoy the music and view. I'm for sure the people here are A+ people.  This is not your typical club....really it's not. - Enjoy!",

While there, you'll quickly regret having shown up. The music could be better, the extremely limited seating is haphazardly placed and the drinks watered down. Get bottled beer if you must.\n\nWorst of all, the restrooms are beyond gross! On busy nights, even the men's room routinely has long lines! Not enough urinals or stalls for the amount of people they let in. Unfortunately, on more than one occasion I have witnessed people relieving themselves on the floor out of frustration from waiting! I've brought it to the attention of a \"manager\" on the floor but never notice any immediate action taking place. Pretty sad... \n\nSo, go if you must, such as when invited for a birthday gathering or just because there's no other dance floor around, but better (and more sanitary) choices are just an Uber away..",

I'm not coming to a Wine House to buy jam or pepper spread, I'm coming to buy wine, so why would I want dusty pre-made baskets that look like there from the 1970's?\n\nAfter passing by the gift basket area, the wine selection was mainly just against one wall.  The organization of the wine was lacking and I was annoyed that in order to find the price I needed to pick up every bottle and try to read the hand written chicken scratch on the back of each bottle.  We are in the 21st century and price tags seem appropriate especially when trying to find wine that would fit my budget.  I found myself picking up $20 bottles as well as $100 bottles just trying to find something with the price point I wanted.  \n\nOne glance in our direction and one could easily assess that we were first time shoppers at the store.  Two men were in the middle of the store behind the counter talking to each other and never once offered to help with the store layout or offering up any wine recommendations.  It's not often I can say that no one offered to assist me but it's true at Rozi's Wine House.  \n\nMost of their space was dedicated to a decent beer selection on the other side of the room.  As Cara L. stated \"They should change the name to Rozi's Beer House\".  You could even create your own Six Pack with the variety of bottles laid out on the shelves.  We opted to create our own after seeing the abysmal wine selection and chose six local Colorado Beers (prices written on the back of the bottles).  \n\nI expected a lot more from a family run operation, in wine selection and customer service.",

I'll stick to the basics and be experimental with the beer instead.",

Large cold case full of a range of friendly, delicious Belgian and Trappist ales?  Check.  Rochefort 10 specifically?  Check.  Typical pricing on all of these wonderful but pricey beers?  Check.  Not that I could even hope to ever find fine fermented delights on the cheap, but one can dream.\nI originally came to Rozi's due to the fact that they, like many Cleveland-area and regional wine shops, carry a fine assortment of ice wines.  Gradually, as my imbibing horizons widened, I came to realize that their beer selection is pretty healthy, as well.  Outside of the previously noted (and celebrated, celebrated, celebrated) Belgian and Trappist imports, they also carry a wide variety of domestics and micro-brews (as well as home-brewing supplies, if you're into that sort of thing).  It's the kind of wine/beer shop that, if it was in my hometown, I'd probably spend a pretty decent amount of time in, perusing the shelves and trying many a new brew.\nA pretty decent little shop with a pretty decent selection.  \"Pretty decent\" works across the board as a description for Rozi's, actually - not the best place I've ever been to, but clean, with friendly, knowledgable staff who will let you roam in peace, and Rochefort 10.  Did I mention that already?  Oh, I certainly did.  There's just got to be a distinctive reason.  Go try a bottle already.",

Yeah, right, I thought. \n\nWell, they're right, this is probably the best beer selection that I've seen in Cleveland, and is a close second that I've ever seen, next to Tiffany's in Kalamazoo, Michigan. \n\nHowever, this honor is for the the quality of their beer selection not the quantity. This is a beer snob's beer store. If you appreciate beer more than just bud and miller, then Rozi's is for you. \n\nWhile the quantity of beers that they have is not very large - about at least 6 to 8 coolers, their beer selection, primarily beers from Europe, including special sections devoted to Belgians and Russians, is a sight to behold. There's even a devoted shelf for sour beers. I agree with Murray, the number of beers there is may be less than Simone's but there's more rarer beers here. You can also buy singles here as well, breaking up the six-packs, score. \nIn addition to their European beers, there's a large selection of microbrews from the USA and Mexico, including founders, Stone, dogfish, left hand, Buckeye, and a full line of Goose Island [I didn't know Goose Island makes special four packs].\nThere's also a selection of home brewing supplies including yeasts, hops, bottle caps, and buckets. \n\nThey also sell kegs of microbrews *******note to future CM: keep this in mind for future elite events, thanks **********  if you ever want to binge drink in style. \n\nI spent a good 20-30 minutes in here without even looking at their wine, which makes up over half of the store.",

I rode the hog(huffy) down to the library for some spooky cd's and stopped by Rozi's for pumpkin or autumnal beer. Ended up getting the Brooklyn Oktoberfest and Post Rd pumpkin(also Brooklyn). Yeah, they're not exactly the rarest of beers to find, but the location and saving a trip to the superhellhole really made my day. Just the browsing itself was awesome. They have Joe Charbonneau beer. For those not in the know, he was a Cleveland Indians star in the making, then just sucked after his rookie year. That and other local brews are for sale. Most of the stuff was too rich for my blood alcohol. Lots of American micro-brews, not so many imports. Simone's is the place for imports.\n\nThe staff was way friendly, even to a scruffy looking dude with a backpack. Said backpack was used to carry all the goodness home papoose-style on my lap so none of it fell out all over Warren rd. Did i mention it's almost Halloween? So stoked. But it never lasts long enough.",

Usually, when I go to the store I find a couple of ciders; however, at the store they have a large selection.\n\n The other nice benefit is that the store has a build your own beer container. So you can mix and match different types of beer. This is really great if you want to either try something new or you don't know what you like. I really enjoyed mixing and trying new beer.\n\n The only thing I would note is that it is a bit difficult to find the price of the drink. The store has most of the tags written on the drink with a pen. This caused me to walk out with a $12 beer that I ended up hating. \n\nThis store was great overall and I intend to go back",

The toro maki roll was the best sushi I've ever had, the fatty tuna just melted in your mouth. The restaurants Sommelier even stopped by to find the best sake pairing with the meal I had. 5 stars!

We waited 15 minutes to be seated.  \nWe followed the waiter's recommendation of one appetizer and one entree per person to share with the table.  \nWe had the beef carpaccio, short ribs and rock shrimp tempura.  All three dishes were delicious! My favorite app was the beef carpaccio. \nFor dinner, we ordered the pork belly bib bim bap (this was cooked at the table), the black cod and the rock fish.  The rock fish came whole and was so tender.  The black cod was extremely flavorful and was my favorite main dish. The bib bim bap was probably the best I've ever had.  \nWe also ordered a couple cocktails, which were good, but the food was the showcase of our experience.  \nHigh recommend Morimoto!",

Since it's a Japanese restaurant I tried to stick to the Japanese dishes like the chirashi, chef's combination sushi, soft shell crab roll and Hamachi kama. The fish was pretty fresh but the fish in my chirashi was cut into various random shapes which makes me feel like they are using scrap fish. \n\nService was great and they were speedy with our order since we were time crunched to go to a show.\n\nHowever the flavor and the expectations of a Japanese restaurant weren't met for me. I really wish they would stick to their own cuisine.",

I also ordered the French Onion soup.  That was good.  The service, however, was slow.  I don't think the bartender was behind the bar more than 1/3 of the time I sat there.\n\nThere were only about 15 or so people in the restaurant, but, I'm warning you, that this place is uncharacteristically LOUD.  I'm not sure why the acoustics are what they are, but my ears are still ringing.  \n\nThen 3 'regulars' strolled in and started yapping it up.  Further, they decided to play lewd videos on one of their phone's with the volume cranked up.  Nice.  Thanks for exhibiting sheer narcissism and complete disregard for anyone around you!  One person in the party starts telling a story about his friend in Vegas and how this friend kept yelling \"hey fatso\".  The worse part was the guy telling the story actually yelled it at the bar.  Seriously, wtf!?!?!?\n\nI had planned on dinner and another glass of wine, but had to cut bait and beat feet out of there asap.  Too many reasons to leave.

I ate a small portion of it before my jaw got tired of gnawing at it, and gave up. I went to Applebee's (yes, The 'Bees) the next day to get one of their $10 sirloins to cleanse my palate of the Austin's steak that cost several dollars more.

A while later we bought a Restaurant.Com coupon. We finally decided to use it and headed off to Austins. When we got there we were told that the coupon had expired.

I did not make sense not to honor the coupon because we were there to expand their customer base. What difference did it make as to when we decided to use the coupon. We decided to leave which amazed the manager. I can't actually review the restaurant because we never have eaten there. I can only say that if you have a Restauran.com coupon they will not honor it and also don't look at the menu because it is never right.",

When we finished, no one brought the check, even though the bartender could clearly see us. We slid our dirty dishes to the end of the table, hoping that someone would notice that we were done. Nope. I finally asked the bartender for the manager. At this point I was just mad, and it got worse when he denied walking past us and, I kid you not, started YELLING AT ME. This went on for a while, in front of other diners. At least we finally got our check. It was my husband's birthday. I'd give zero stars if I could.",

Wine, Liquor, and Beer! There is no where else in town that you can find as many quality bottles of Whiskey...or Tequila...or Rhone Blends...or Sour Beers, et cetera, et cetera.\n\nThe store is always well organized and clean. Customer Service is consistently excellent! Every staff member has a Total Wine shirt on and is easy to spot. Many of the staff are quite knowledgeable about the products of the store, but they all are able to point you to an expert if you need more refined help.\n\nThey have some of the best prices around, and if that's not enough, I recently saw a sign saying they will match any competitor's price...You can even do some one-stop shopping for snacks as well. Really, what's not to love?\n\nI've been a big fan of Total Wine & More in Boca Park for many years.  I first came in because of its proximity to my residence, but I kept coming back because of the above-and-beyond service I've received over the years. I greatly appreciate that they offer classes and tastings to educate customers in everything from wine to beer to spirits, often including food pairing suggestions as well. There is certainly a lot they are doing right at Total Wine & More!\n\n-2017 review #61-",

Price is ok, but I come here for enjoyment and service.  Coming here is like going to a 5 zagat restaurant. The workers are dressed as waiters in an upscale restaurant.  Store is gorgeous. I love coming here for Christmas shopping as well.  I also enjoy online shopping on their website.",

And while those two things go far in my book, it's one last superlative that really gets under my skin:\n\nThe customer service is atrocious. \n\nI think because the workers know that people will always love imbibing alcohol, and that they have a great selection, then they don't have to actually work more than necessary and certainly not have to care about customer service at all. \n\nI find it odd that many of the floor workers didn't make any eye contact. I prefer to shop alone until I'm ready but when I am, I'd like to be able to find someone easily. \n\nIt seemed that when I was there, the only one who had help was the lady who had a large party that required cases and cases. \n\nAnd don't even get me started with the cashiers. A skinny blonde woman was snooty  and short with me when I asked about buying a wine crate. Sorry. Did I bother her by asking her to do her job? And the cashiers closed and opened registers at will as if there were no customers waiting. Maybe her blood sugar was getting low and she was in danger of actually avoiding diabetes. No ma'am, please take that Twinkie break lest you fall below the obese categorization. \n\nI guess people will always need to get their drink on. But I'm sure this place could find people who actually know how to provide customer service. I mean if BevMo! can do better, why can't TWM? \n\nI guess I should only come there drunk so I won't care about the zombies collecting a paycheck.",

He is a doll and took a couple days to decide which beers to get (selecting good beers, some pricier than others, knowing I needed 25 bottles or cans so I wouldn't spend my life savings).\n\nOn Dec 1, 2014, I went into Total Wine (with my 2-year-old in tow) and frantically looked for the beers on my list.  Okay.  There are a million beers.  Not knowing what the bottles or cans looked like made this task impossible!  I found a Total Wine beer guy and showed him my phone list and he grabbed them one by one and filled my cart.  Score!\n\nThere was only one beer they had run out of by the time I went in, so the beer guy gave me another suggestion.\n\n5 stars for selection, 5 stars for service.  My hubby was SUPER surprised.",

Still can't find what you're looking for? They'll order it for you!\n\nTheir tequila and sake selections are the best I've found in the valley, they have every beer you can imagine (tons of Rogue), and I've found other gems here such as: Slim Bob & Skinny Chick's original margarita mix ($6.99) - it's so tasty and only 15 calories a serving (before spirits added of course)!\n\nThe sell great gift items, stemware (Ridel baby), and treats like blueberry yogurt covered pretzels *YUM*! And don't miss their extensive mini bottle collection! The staff is always friendly and helpful, the checkout lines are never long, and the store is HUGE!

Decided to do the order and check yourself out but it doesn't accept payment so after you try and avoid the line it tells you to go to an open register which there is only one with the long line. THEN the payment system for paying with your phone didn't work so luckily I had my wallet with my actual card there. The staff is aware of the wait as they usually say \"sorry about the wait\". On a Saturday at noon, you should have 2 people at the register.",

Got there just after 10 PM for a late dinner date with my hubby, and they didn't hassle us for coming in at that time and ordering a full dinner, even with the restaurant closing at 11.

When we ordered our drinks and food we told our waiter that we wanted The largest margarita they had that was on the happy hour. he said that was great and then asked us what type of tequila we wanted in each drink. We each told him our tequila choices. We sat there for about 3 1/2 to 4 hours eating and drinking and having a good time. Got our checks and were horrified that each of our margaritas were $15!! How did the price go from what was supposed to be $5 a drink to $15. When we confronted the waiter he said we got premium alcohol, so they weren't happy hour. We were floored. If picking out your tequila was extra, he should have never asked us!! We told him we wanted happy hour margaritas from the very beginning. We got the manager involved and he basically said that there must have been a misunderstanding but he was standing behind the pricing. Really?! Then when  questioned if premium alcohol was on happy hour he said it was $2.50 a shot. If that was the case, I could have accepted the $5 margarita charge with $2.50 for the extra shot of premium tequila. Where $15 came from is BEYOND me. Horrible customer service. We were pretty vocal about our upset (some of us got multiple drinks). He later came back to try and redeem himself and said he would take 20% off the entire bill. It was better than nothing, but we won't be going back. I still paid $5 more than I should have. Great way to ruin a wonderful night for us!",

Its a fairly comfortable place to eat, and it's better for you than a Baconator (although, that does sound delicious right about now).\n\nThey tend to water down their Sriracha, but it might be more of a heat thing rather than a cost cutting thing. Sriracha can be a bit spicy for some.\n\nThe spicy chicken bowl is the way to go. Try it. Don't listen to my old review. I was probably having a bad day at work.",

Most teriyaki joint use reconstituted shoe leather for their steak dishes (or at least it seems that way based on how tough that \"steak\" usually is!). Samurai Sam's uses true steak (flank steak if I had to wager a guess) and its honestly cooked to perfection! It's thick cut and extremely flavorful. \n\nSpicy Steak and Pepper Bowl is my go to but any combo of meat, veggies, rice and sauce is going to be a winner. \n\nPot stickers are great, egg rolls are not bad and price is definitely right. \n\nThe staff is almost always very friendly and the place is cleaned and maintained very well.

They also have free valet parking if dining at Stoke (located inside the Marriott hotel).The hostess made sure to ask if we were okay with a booth; which we all said yes too, the only strange part was she motioned me to go ahead of her. I was aimlessly walking because how am I supposed to know which table you are seating me? The interior was modern rustic. The made sure to incorporate wood pieces but still made it modern in style. The plates were a combination of ceramic plates and wooden boards. It is a lot bigger than it seems to be \"just inside a hotel.\" The attire is casual but many did dress a little nicer.\nWe sat down and were quickly greeted by our waitress Molly. The menu is a little on the small side (fits on one big paper) but the flavors are definitely all there! All of us decided to share so we could try everything since we have never been here before and also to share the cost.\nFrom the Share:\n- Pretzel Brioche: Came with three different butters; I believe the first one had garlic and whole grain beads inside (my favorite of the three). Next, they had a cheerwine butter; you are in the south after all. Lastly, was a honey butter and just as most are; sweet but not too much. Usually pretzel breads/rolls are a little harder but this was so soft and the little bit of saltiness from the pretzel was great.\n- Mom's Deviled Eggs: Love that they chopped the bread and butter pickles to put on top instead of putting one big piece of it like I have seen other restaurants do. In order for them to lay flat on the plate they have to cut the bottom, this makes it a little thinner so be careful.\n- Pork Belly: Absolutely delicious. I was worried the watermelon molasses was going to be too sweet but it was just right, not sticky and gross. I would rather not share this item because of the portion size. The bottom was charred and it gave the dish a great crunch and smoky flavor to each bite.\n- Winter Roots: Plated beautifully and when added to our entrees, went well. It was also a nice palette cleanser if ate alone. Included beets, radishes, caraway, and buttermilk.\nFrom the Entree:\n- Scallops: They had five on the plate but they were not small. The were cooked perfectly. They were placed on top of a ham hock consomm\u00e9; which was at the right level, not overflowing but enough to taste.\n- Sticky Pork Shank: We asked what the menu favorite was and this was what was recommended. This did not let us down. Definitely my favorite dish of the night. The meat fell off the bone, was not dry, and the sauce was there but not even needed (but who doesn't love sauces).\nFrom the Companions: \n- Esquites: This corn salad was delicious but definitely a sharing side dish.\n- Crispy fingerlings: These potatoes were cooked to have a slight crunch, that usually you don't get, and it was paired with a creamy aioli. My only suggestion - have the aioli come on the side and not the bottom below several fingerlings.\n- Green Beans: Had a little spice to them, a nice crunch from the pistachios, and the apples added a crunch but a sweet acidity as well.\n- Broccoli: I personally did not eat this because I do not like broccoli that much but the other two did. They agreed there was a spice to it which is unexpected but it was tasty overall. \nFrom the Dessert Menu: (This is a completely separate menu that you have to ask for)\n- Apple Pie: We also got a scoop of vanilla ice cream to accompany the pie. It was served warm and came out in a mini cast iron skillet. The crust was too hard and not flaky (we could barely cut it) but the filling was the best part! They topped it with oats instead of a dutch crumble and I personally like the added crunch this gave to the dessert.\nFrom the Cocktails:\n- Espresso Martini: I love coffee/espresso and when you mix it with Kahlua, even better. The glass was unexpectedly small but it tasted great and I hope the pour count was accurate!\nOverall a great first time experience, will definitely be going back!",

            "text": "Husband and I had breakfast here before we left to head back  home. I will say; you are seeking variety for breakfast this may not be your first choice. The A.M. menu is limited to (3) \"lite options\", (7) full plate options and (12) side items to include the meats(4) and breads (3). I had the Avacado toast, which is served on Rye, over-medium eggs and sausage. My husband had stuffed French toast and an omelet. \n\nMy Avacado toast was different than what I'm used to; sliced and laid over the toast as opposed to smashed/blended w/olive oil, ricotta type cheese, but it was good. Eggs were fresh, prepared as ordered and though the sausage was good it didn't have any kick/spice, which may be fine for most. \n\nMy husband really enjoyed the stuffed French toast w/fruit and his omelet. The French toast was stuffed with a ricotta mixture, coated with Rice Crispys and cooked on a griddle I believe. Really different take on stuffed French toast but very tasty. \n\nI was confused as to why we were served toast that seemed to have been toasted twice and a bit hard to eat but it was left on the plate as was my frustration with it!  \n\nBased on what appears to be a menu of fantastic fare, I think we would have really enjoyed the dinner as well but we had to get on the road so maybe next visit!",

My party came here to celebrate a special occasion, and I definitely was not feeling very celebratory after we left. \n\nMultiple things were forgotten by our server, yes there were 7 of us, and sure maybe forget a dish or two - but not four. Especially when it is slow. \n\nGot the pork, and it was tender but way over salted. The bone marrow was seasoned strangely, with too much ginger (I think that was the mystery flavor). The fingerlings were harder on the inside, not soft and warm like they should've been. BBQ carrots did not seem BBQ'd at all. Small green salad was ice burg lettuce. The deviled eggs were good however. The pretzel was delivered way after we ordered it, but the butters were amazing. I did not try any of the deserts but the donut looked great when they brought it to another table. \n\nThe drink menu was extensive, and not in a good way, especially when your server doesn't know how to explain the ingredients/accurately describe how certain things taste. This is unacceptable when paying $14-17 a cocktail. \n\nMost annoying however was that no where does it say they automatically add 20% gratuity. If I do not receive great service, I should not have to leave a great tip - that choice should be mine, or at least give fair warning that you are going to add that to my bill. We had no choice to leave an amazing tip (because this place is so OVERPRICED) and we were met with eye rolls, sighs, empty drinks, gross food, and a server who couldn't even remember our order/forget to put it in. \n\nI will not be back, needless to say.",

It's not that big, but there's plenty of seating. Parking is valet only, but the restaurant validates the parking.\n\nWe were seated withing 5 minutes. Our server was Colby (I think?) and she was fantastic. She was friendly and attentive throughout the entire meal.\n\nWe ordered:\nGarbage fries $9\nTrout $18\nChicken BLT $10\nSteak sandwich $10\nThe burger $12\nShrimp & Grits $18\n1 lb donut\n\nWe asked for the gravy on the side for the garbage fries, and we actually enjoyed it better without the gravy. We loved the size and crispiness of the fries. Our orders were cooked to our liking. We really enjoyed the flavors. The portions were great and prices were reasonable. My son loved his shrimp and grits. He devoured the shrimp in minutes. I only finished half of my steak sandwich and took the rest to go. It was delicious and very filling. My husband and mother had difficulty finishing their orders as well. My mother took half of her chicken BLT to go, too. The donut was amazing! Even with 5 people, we could not finish it. We definitely took the rest to go and ate it later that day for snack. \n\nGreat experience and great meal. We will definitely return!",

I managed to get transferred to the hotel attendant on one of my calls where he confirmed that they were open.

We got to choose one option from three different courses- appetizer, entree and dessert. I got the pan seared scallop which was AMAZING! It was in a green pea bisque which was astonishingly tasty. I wasn't completely sure what to expect of a pea soup but it was slightly sweet and paired perfectly with the scallop. For my entree I got the flat iron steak cooked medium and it was perfect. It came with a warm corn salad that was sweet and savory in all the best ways. One of the other people I went with got the smoked pork belly and I think hands down it was the best dish I tried all night. The pork belly was on top of a brick of sticky rice with some sauce on it and I wish I had gotten that dish instead. My only issue with it was that it was a noticeably smaller portion than all the other entree dishes. For dessert my boyfriend got the doughnut holes which was a smaller rendition of their infamous one pound (yes 1 lb!) doughnut. Basically the chef took that large doughnut and pulled pieces from it to make smaller balls rolled in cinnamon sugar with diplomat cream topped with crushed Heath bar. That was stellar and I'd recommend trying their normal doughnut to anyone who had the opportunity to. All around I'd definitely encourage everyone to go to Stoke",

Nice portion size so I had to take some home. The croutons were hard as well as the garlic bread which was also cold when served. Hubby liked his cheese curd bacon burger.

One employee had a constant need to pull and fix her long hair. Not sure if she was a server, but I worry if she handled food. Lots of loud conversation at that register. \n\nThe greeter sat us and proceeded to babble a paragraph of mumbles about something about the several beers they offered. I asked her to repeat, but still had a tough time understanding. We then met their \"Guest Experience Captain\". She was also hard to understand and my wife and I enjoyed the irony of being offered the guest experience captain and wondered if she had subordinates, but never had the opportunity to ask, because she blew out of there immediately and we noticed a replacement who never came by, only because she was wearing a football jersey identifying her.\n\nThe food. Greasy, bland bar food. Not priced right for that atmosphere. Overpriced. $15 for wings? I guess drinking makes the price palatable.

It's such an irresponsible use of this service doing so. You can rant all you want in the comments. Almost didn't come here because of the 2 and a half stars. All I care is about the food, nothing else.\n\nSauces wise, the spicy garlic isn't garlicky at all. If you like curry, the Thai curry was actually great. My mom loved the lemon pepper the most, I'd agree if I didn't think wingstops lemon pepper was better. It's missing more of that puckering goodness. The wild sauce was my favorite hot sauce. Then there's blazin.. I love the heat/spiciness but damn.. it's just not that good flavor wise. Just being honest.",

            "text": "I see lots of negative reviews and I don't get it. It's a sports bar not a 5 star restaurant. They have great wings with tons of flavor choices, one of the best happy hours around and tons of TV's. They also have the baseball package so you can watch any game. For a Texas Ranger fan in AZ, that's important.  The beer is always ice cold and the place is one of the cleaner BWW I've been too. I love the big screen right over the bar. It's huge!!  During happy hour you can get the street tacos for $4 and they are really good. The fried pickles and chili queso dip is really good too.  Oh yea...free WiFI.",

But I go to Vegas once a year (missed last year) to visit my family (mother, brothers and inlaws, cousins) for Christmas or other occassions (bdays, graduations).  \n\nMy mom's favorite is shrimp tempura so she almost always gets this.  Food is good enough, pricing I would say is medium. I normally don't pay (the oldest brother does) but for this occasion since this is my mom's bday, I footed the bill.  It was not bad for 6 people (but none of us drink so that helps make sure the bill is decent).\n\nI had the combo (they have plenty of that).  I finished it off.  My sis-in-law got the salmon kale salad and got a taste of it (I enjoyed it very much).  We were there on a Wed night and there was live music (interestingly loungey).  \n\nPricing good, food tastes good. Not too busy on a weeknight.  Everything went well.  Leftovers were brought home to enjoy (my mom).  They also have a tepanyaki (grill) so if you want anything grilled, even if you are on the non-grill side, it will take some time so we forgo that order for the husband.  He had the beef teriyaki and by the sign of the leftovers, was not enthusiastic about it.\n\nNo reservations needed on a weeknight.",

            "text": "I absolutely LOVE Osaka. My primary reason for dining there is their Teppan Grill. The chefs create a fun, entertaining show while preparing your food in front of you, however you like it prepared. It's great for the kids (and they have a toy filled treasure chest for them to dig into!). Some of the dishes can get just a little bit pricey but you get a TON of items included with your dish. For example, I get the filet mignon ($28) but this includes salad, soup, your entree, appetizer shrimp, rice, veggies AND ice cream! The servers are friendly and they come back often to check on you and fill up your drinks (my pet peeve). Can't afford the dinner time prices? Stop in for lunch from 12-3pm and enjoy your favorites from $8.95!\n\nMake sure you sign up for their email club before you go. You'll get a 10% off coupon and also get a VIP Osaka card while your there. You can earn money for future Osaka visits. Enjoy :)",

The first Osaka I ever visited was years ago near my house on Lake Mead/Rainbow which offered terrific service, great atmosphere and great sushi. However, I went back and that location changed. But this is the REVIEW for Osaka on Eastern now, so here we go. \n\nAfter a hard day of work we (8 people) went to Osaka's with reservations and were promptly seated at one of those tables (forgive my ignorance) where you take your shoes off and your legs hang under. Within seconds of ordering drinks they were already out and we were pouring Sapporo for everyone and a Tokyo Tea for one of the girls at the table. \n\nWe ordered a couple of appetizers, cooked dishes and sushi. More than enough food for the table! Everyone raved about how good the food was I tried everything. One of the rolls NOT on their menu is the virgin roll, make sure you give it a try. The sushi was very fresh, flown in that morning.\n\nWe ended the night with green tea ice cream ;)",

If you're looking for a subdued environment, don't visit!  Very boisterous and noisy with sports on every TV.  I noticed many ordering pizza and I may try sometime.

They decided to only put ONE piece of chicken on my salad this time but sure enough it cost the same overinflated price. $13 for a small piece of chicken and some lettuce. I can make the same thing myself for under $5. Give me a break. I'm tired of the scaling back and inconsistency from this place. Last time I ate in, they wouldn't let me use my dinner coupon because they said that \"the salads aren't dinners\" when the last time I checked a $13 grilled chicken salad is more than enough food to be considered a dinner?

I searched them up on here just to check the reviews, and 3.5 stars and cheap eats were enough to make us choose this place. However, my experience was only 2 stars.\n\nSince it was more so brunch time, I went for breakfast! Got 2 eggs w/cheese, 2 sausage patties, home fries and 2 pancakes. First thing, when my food arrived to the table, my eggs were missing cheese. I mentioned it to the server who was helping us and she just said they would take it off the bill. Not a huge deal. Then I noticed there was only 1 sausage patty and my home fries were dry as cardboard. I'm not usually the picky type, but when the quality is this bad and my order was wrong.. \n\nOverall, cheap prices and half decent service. I wonder if ordering lunch at that time of day would have been better, but doesn't look like it based on other reviews.",

Next time I go Im having their eggs Benedict w homemade Canadian Bacon! Mmm even their coffee is excellent! I had their BLT stacked about large portion of Bacon on it I Say try Bobs you'll love it!",

We were then seated at a table in the very back directly across from the bathrooms...appetizing!  In all fairness she asked if that was ok but we were hungry and had our infant with us so we said ok- the point here is that there shouldn't be a table there to begin with! \n\nTook 10 min to get greeted and 20 min for our food.  Although busy, the allure of a diner is the quick service and cheap prices- which were NOT cheap!  It was nearly $9 for an omelet with any cheese and 2 choices of veggies or meat.  Each additional option was 50 cents.  If you wanted a western it was nearly $10! I think this is a lot compare to other diners like Toms in dormont.  \n\nAfter waiting for what felt like forever, the food was really good.  The turkey sausage was really salty though and they only gave a tiny cup of syrup for the pancake, which was luke warm.  \n\nWe might try this one more time but not for a while.  Let them work out the kinks!",

The waiter walked by several times when we were waiting and didn't even ask us if we needed anything. Once he was even whistling. Once it finally came I asked for some marinara sauce for the crust. The sauce had a very overwhelming taste of red wine. We wanted to order dessert but my sister was on her lunch break and we ran out of time since the pizza took too long.

            "text": "The customer service at this restaurant is terrible.  I am baffled that they are still in business.  The owner is extremely overwhelmed each and every time I attempt purchase food and he seems to be the only one working most of the time.  Honestly I have called to order food at least five times and every single time I have been put on hold for 10-20 minutes.  My husband and I laugh because this business is a HOT mess.  When have never actually been able to order food over the phone because they can't get their act together.  Additionally, we live close by so we have tried to walk there and order in person.  That hasn't been a success either.  The owner can only handle doing one thing at a time so if he is cooking, or whatever he does in the back, he doesn't come out to greet customers.  Honestly, you can stand there for 5 minutes and he doesn't acknowledge that you are there saying \"hello\".  \n\nI have also tried to order gelato several times because they have a neon gelato sign in the window.  I was successful one time and it was great.  The nutella flavor was unreal, so good.  The problem it's usually broken because it gets too hot in the restaurant during the summer months.  Ironically, many people want something cold when it's hot outside.  It's a shame.  This guy can't seem to get it right.  \n\nI have successfully ordered a pizza one time and never went back.  The dough is very yeasty.  Not worth the wait.  I would pass on this one.",

You will lovee the family meatballs- with homemade marinara sauce on top of pasta :D ITS LIKE HAVING YOUR NONA'S MEATBALLS DURING PASTA FAMILY DINNERS \n\nThe baked wings were a little disappointing.  It looks like the wings weren't flipped on the other side so one side was slightly soggy.  Skip the BBQ and Honey Mustard sauce- the BBQ sauce is glorified ketchup with cinnamon and apple cider vinegar.\n\nThe house specialty pizza is all right- the sauce is nothing too special, but the crust is delicious.  They need to put more sauce on the pizza and slice the olives so the olives don't overpower the rest of it.  \n\nTheir gelato flavors are pretty good, but vary day to day.  Some are hit or miss.  The best flavor is the lemon.\n\nThe menu is a little limited to just pizza, subs, pasta, and small amount of appetizers, but perfect if you are looking from some delicious pasta and gelato. It's disappointing that the pizza and wings were not that good.  \n\nI'll give it another try again soon, but probably with subs and pasta instead of pizza.",

The crust was just really really hard and overall the cheese mixture was kind of strange in texture and followed through with the taste. \n\nBut it's Little Italy, I'm sure I'll find pizza somewhere.",

We don't order pizza, but the menu items we enjoy for lunch are reasonably priced and have always been served hot and fresh.\n\nMy favorite lunch item is penne pasta with marinara. It comes with a decent portion of pasta, house salad, and a generous order of garlic bread with mozzarella. That's about 8 bucks and I'm full when I leave. I've also had the barbecue chicken sub as well as the chicken and broccoli calzone. All three are tasty and filling enough for me.\n\nThere are, maybe, four tables in the place, so dining-in won't be for everyone. We have often arrived to find local Italians (some we know) in there having animated, boisterous conversation while eating, adding to the charm of being in Little Italy.\n\nThe three of us like the owner a lot, though most times he is very busy and often works solo. He could definitely use some reliable, competent help to keep up with demand, but our experience at lunchtime has always been good. It's a reliable place for us to have an enjoyable, relaxing meal away from the rigors of our work",

Unfortunately, the food did not taste half as good and the potion size has reduced considerably during our last 4 visits. I think the prices have gone up too. When I called to let them know about the food quality and potion size, I was simply told that the chef has changed. Their cakes are quite decent though. But then we are never going back to this place esp when you have so many other good Indian food choices around the same area.",

What made me mad more than anything, 6 TV's by the games all playing something different for a variety and some young worker comes and changes all them to Sports!!!!    NOT everyone wants to watch Sports.   ALL 6 TV's all same channel???   Guess it didn't matter that people were watching what was on there before you changed it!!\n\n***UPDATE*** Don't bother passing this on to the manager ..... I spoke to the manager as we left he said that it was requested for the sports, they might have requested for sports but on ALL 10 - 12 TVs????",

            "text": "Pizza was recommended from a friend and while in Vegas a small group consisting of 3 children and 2 adults visited this restaurant.\nWe were greeted warmly upon entering.  The restaurant is brightly lit and was clean with several tv's showing different channels. It was generally empty at the 8pm time frame we arrived. We were given suggestions on what promo/menu item to order for the best bang for our buck.  Prices were a bit high for my taste however the kids wanted to play the games so we order two one-item pizza's.\nPizza arrived quickly and was hot.  The pizza tasted ok but was not extraordinary from other sit down pizza chains. No slices were left over so the kids liked it.\nThe gaming area at the back of the restaurant was more busy with children and parents.  Tokened games were all working and the children enjoyed using the tokens they were given.  There was a prize redemption area where they could turn in their tickets for cheap knick-knacks.\nOverall the restaurant was a hit for the children with just ok pizza. I was luckily able to watch an NFL game while the kids played the games.",

I was informed that after the hour and a half time frame I did not have to leave but I had to close my tab. I was still waiting on more people to come so pizza wouldn't get cold so I order about 15 minutes after time I booked my party and did not get my pizzas for about 45 minutes I was told that they had other people ordering so it was in order but if I only have an hour and a half and it's takes almost 1 hour to get the pizza then we have almost no time left. I order more stuff while still waiting on my 1st order. Waiting for food takes a very long time. The hostess was very kind but did not have much time for us I was nice because I could tell she was busy she had another party and still do other stuff. I had to search for her everytime I needed something so I spend a lot of time trying to get things and looking for the host. I think maybe if they know they have more then 1 party that day they should schedule another person. She was kind though so it made it better. \nThe play area is really small and they don't have much for smaller children. \nAlso, they have this thing where birthday child gets to make their own pizza but I never got mine I was informed about it in beginning but looking for host and trying to get the pizzas that I did order just took too long so I just said forget it. \nOverall because the hostess was kind, the kids did have fun, and it is a reasonable price I give it 4 stars. They could personalize the parties more and maybe have a host that only has 1 party and is dedicated to just you and your party AND maybe not wait too long on the pizza and mean we do have a time frame.",

Kung Fu clips are constantly playing, hence the name, but when it gets busy, a line goes out the door, the entrance which is also the exit is obstructed which wouldn't make the Fire Marshall happy.\n\nBEVERAGES:\n\nHaving been here a couple of times, I've tried their Taro boba smoothie and on our second visit, I noticed that they also had a Matcha smoothie. I LOVE the two flavors blended together, so since they had the two flavors, and I was willing to pay, I asked if they could blend the two together, but the girl told me they don't do that, (you have the two flavors, I was willing to pay extra...WTH? Made me wanna get all 5 Deadly Venoms up in here!!!!) Anywho,  I settled for a Strawberry Milk Boba smoothie which was good, but not what I wanted. I guess places don't like to deviate from their menu items but maybe I should've asked the guy who actually makes the drinks if he'd do it...better yet, why not offer to have flavors blended since you already give options like toppings and sweetness levels! Their boba is also firmer than usual, but still good. Although they have a good variety to choose from, I also wish they would offer a bigger size, like 32 ounces.\n\nCLOSING STATEMENTS:\n\nThis is a good place, but I'll probably stick to my favorite spots where they'll be able to make my favorite boba smoothie blend with no problem.

My favorite drink is the white gourd (white gourd being a winter melon) green tea with nata jelly (which I believe is coconut jelly) at regular sweetness. It has a slight bitterness that I like and is not too too sweet. It is a taste that is indescribable and unique on its own. Drinks are always consistent and not lacking once you find your go-to drink.\n\nI love the energy of the staff here; they always acknowledge when you walk in and walk out in loud voices which is a wonderful plus. They are knowledgeable about the menu and will help out find a drink suitable for your taste. If the drink doesn't come out how you like they will gladly do any adjustments or suggest changing your drink entirely.\n\nI also like that they will have daily samples sometimes so you can try out new drinks and find one that works for you. I honestly found my love of the white gourd this way when they introduced it through samples. If not, then I would have never tried or found it because the very sound of the name doesn't give me any idea to how the drink would taste. \n\nOn other visits with other people or through samples I've gotten to try the Oreo Oolong Milk Tea, Pineapple Sunshine Tea, Longan date tea, Mango Green tea, WOW Matcha with red bean, and Hot Taro Milk tea, among others. Defintiely the most drinks than I'll ever get to try at any other cafe/coffee shop for sure :p\n\nAnother plus is that they are open till 11pm or Midnight and there is free wi-fi (pw: iluvboba). Sometimes you'll see people sitting down for long periods of time on their computers. Great vibe and hangout place (:",

            "text": "One of my favorite go to boba places. Their drinks are worth going back to every single time. I highly recommend the Longan Red Date tea. It has such a fruity, sweet taste that I can finish in under a minute. No added topping necessary because it has dates and longan bits floating around. If you're feeling a little creamy, I'd recommend the Wintermelon (White Gourd) Milk tea, which is has the perfect balance of sweetness and tartness with the creaminess; you can't go wrong. Honestly, the place has amazing drinks; I havent found one that I didnt like. One of the things I didnt find appealing though is how small the place is. Most of the time, it's so packed that the line goes outside, you're literally standing shoulder to shoulder with someone, even when the place didnt even have that many people. It's just small. Also, it's in an area that sees a lot of traffic. It's in a very busy and compact complex so parking is often difficult. I also kinda wish they stayed open a little later than 11pm. Other boba places are open later so it's kind of a missed opportunity in my opinion.",

You can actually taste the tea rather than the sugar (I ordered 0% sugar), and it had a lovely fresh flavor. No sugar was needed. The honey lemonade was also very good. Tangy but not overwhelming. Just has that pick me up, refreshing zest to it. The boba was chewy with a nice bite, neither tough nor soggy. The herbal jelly was beautiful soft and had a subtle flavor that went well with the milk tea.\n\nWe enjoyed it so much, we visited three times during our short stay. Their service was excellent too and they made it a point to ask for feedback and apologize for the \"wait\" (I waited 5 minutes because  there was a line). They should set up shop in SoCal. Or maybe not, coz I would be spending too much money here!",

I liked the idea that guest can customize the level of sugar they want their drinks to be.\n\nI selected a medium taro green milk tea with regular sugar, added boba.  Maybe because I was there at 10:30pm, that's why my boba wasn't as chewy and delicious like others have described it to be.  These boba balls were a bit hard.  The taro flavor was super light, and I couldn't taste the green tea.\n\nEarl got the coffee, and didn't realize milk/cream would be added as part of the \"drink.\"\n\nHe drank 1/4 of this and the rest is sitting in the fridge.  I doubt he would even continue to drink it.\n\nOverall, it's ok...I will give it another try.",

I like Americanized Mexican food too.  I go to Taco Bell a couple of times per month. Me gusta los nachos. \nI got chili rojo, cost about $13.  I had enough food for lunch and dinner.\nTheir table salsa is way too mild- I've had spicier breakfast cereal.  But they keep hotter sauce in the back.  Just flag down your waiter and say, \"Senior! Esto no es caliente. Por favor graba mi trasero.\"\nI'd love to see some authentic dishes on the menu there.  They do have some traditional items by name but they're not prepared properly- they taste pretty good though. \nFor example: I had their carnitas once. I didn't watch them make it, but it just tasted like seasoned, boiled pork butt to me.  Pork butt is right but it should be marinated in citrus and seasonings, then fried in manteca using a copper kettle or a large Dutch oven.\nI also noticed several of their beef dishes used steak cuts that wouldn't typically be used in Mexican cooking.  First, you wouldn't find whole steaks- they'd be chopped or diced. And second, they wouldn't use a rib eye, they'd use skirt steak, flank steak, milanessa. \nAnd for those of you that think cheese smothered burritos are authentic Mexican- you will not find cheese smothered burritos in Mexico.  You probably won't even find a burrito outside of your hotel resort.",

I am one who doesn't turn down free food but from Micky Ds I just might.\nThe restaurant, for lack of a better term, itself is nice. Clean and efficient. Nice staff. But overall it is still a McDonald's. Satan won't even eat here. Nor are there any McDonald's in hell because the Devil thinks it is cruel and unusual punishment.\nOn the plus side there are Unicorns in the ball pit and they serve alcohol upstairs but you have to ask nice and know the secret password.\nI will try my best to never go to a McDonald's again but once in a while they have cheap or free Big Macs which might lure me back for a second or two. It is sad that at the mire mention of the word Big Mac I can almost taste one. Ugh.\nI am sure some people like McDonald's and think it is a good value with fast and friendly service. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. In my opinion though with so many other great choices, some a thousand times better, why still go here. Oh well. Evil exists so we know what good is.",

I had to then repeat my order several times as she had difficulty entering my order into the computer. I ordered 2 breakfast sandwich meals with 2 caramel frappes. When the employee finally repeated my order back to me correctly I paid and pulled up to the second window. I noticed that the receipt said 1 caramel frappe and 1 mocha frappe. I notified the employee at the window that the order was incorrect and I actually ordered 2 caramel frappes, she acted annoyed and told the employee making the drinks not to make a mocha frappe (which she had already started making) she then proceeded to look back at me, roll her eyes, and throw the mocha frappe into the trash with a sour look on her face. I could not believe the mistreatment I received when it was THEIR error, not mine. I will not be returning to this location due to the rude, unfriendly, and incompetent staff.",

I'm utterly disappointed again that a McDonald's worker doesn't even seem to have the simple capability of pushing the sweet tea button instead of the regular tea button and even then, brew a regular tea correctly (I believe they switched the sweet tea and regular tea around but even then, the tea was gross). Going home now to spend at least $2.16 in sugar packets to sweeten this baby up, then cry.",

Since I was at work I went ahead and ordered online for my convenience and I put the promo code in the instructions. All of the employees gathered around and we're being very rude saying they weren't going to honor the promo code because they didn't enter it when they saw the order. They were rude and unhelpful including the managers there. It was very unprofessional and embarrassing. They offered me no type of customer service. Keep in mind I am a regular and go very often since I work right up the street. I feel disrespected and at this point all I want is my money back. Oh and one more thing, they put sauce in the sandwich that i had specifically said not to on the instructions as I am allergic. This environment is ridiculous and not to mention the guy infront of me was being treated poorly as well. The corporate office needs to work on their customer service at I17 & dunlap. Never going back again.",

They claim they are freshly made but what I receive tells a completely different story. I suggest either going to the one in Metro mall for the closest location or the one on 1401 Southern Ave. It's far but it's worth the drive. Just saving you money and dissatisfaction.",

They accept contactless payments at this location which means full support for Apple Pay, Android Pay, Samsung Pay, Microsoft Pay, Visa PayWave, MasterCard PayPass.

Our 11 year old son is on the autism spectrum. We go there every Sunday for lunch. We feel welcome and at home the moment we walk in. The owner greets us by name, the sushi chefs wave and our favorite waitress starts Shane's order of two California rolls, miso soup (with a side of ice cubes to cool it), a spring roll and a special orange drink that only he can open. They even gave him a wrapped Christmas gift last year.\n\nIf Shane has a meltdown, they give him space and don't get offended if he does something others may deem inappropriate.\n\nEvery dish we've ever had there is superb. The sushi is the freshest in town. The chefs are incredibly creative and have created some fabulous rolls and Asian fusion dishes. \n\nNot all businesses and restaurants are friendly, accepting and welcoming to families with children on the spectrum. It's an incredible experience when we find one that is willing to get to know Shane for all of his shine and awesomeness and look past some of the behaviors that may occur.  Thanks to the entire staff at Wild East. Your kindness and generosity means more than you'll ever know to our family and others like us. \n\nhttps://www.autismspeaks.org/blog/2016/03/04/waitress-who-goes-above-and-beyond-my-son-autism",

When it was my turn, I handed the tech my Rx. She asked \"do you need this filled today?\" I responded with a yes... to which she said \"actually, we are really busy today it will take 4-5 hours.\" So I asked for it back and told her I'll take it somewhere else.

I'm glad Walgreens provides employment and is a big corporation to do so, but I'm fed up with the run around. \n\nFirst off, the store is always in a cluster and never looks clean at all. No one smiles at you or greets you when you come in. Don't just stare at me wth!!!! Ask if I need any help or something, not walk or stand around with your finger in your ass. The pharmacy is an absolute disaster. They are just order takers. I get it a lot of people in this country are on pills/meds because that's where all the money is. So they are always busy getting stuff wrong and if you want over the counter they tell you what aisle it's on and point you on your way. \n\nI called today and talked directly to the pharmacy and asked If they had Tamiflu which I had a prescription for. I am sick and in desperate need to get better so I can work, not visit Walgreens. I made a SPECIAL trip and go out of my way. When I say I need this filled they say we are out. WTF do you mean you are out, I just called 10 min ago and you said you had it. Well they didn't. It was a halfass apology and the kid behind the pharmacy county could give two sh*ts about anything. Order taking. \n\nNo wonder other reviews are the same. Garbage ratings fitted for this garbage service and establishment. I'm going to make a special trip miles out of the way to go to CVS or somewhere else.",

She goes, \"Well that's not my area so I don't know how you want me to help you, I work up front. That's why we tell you to wait a day before coming back.\" Despite this being a one hour photo kiosk, I let it go. Not only that, SHE approached ME, not vice versa.

I said no, I'm here now because I need these items now. Then Laura proceeds to THROW AWAY MY COUPONS while looking me dead in the eye.

But aside from the high prices (if you can help it, just go to Target people) Walgreens will surprise you with a new and interesting item every now and then. I went to get my disposable cam developed the other day and what did I find? Sitting there on the counter were a bunch of Venus Fly Trap plants. So cool. They're around $5.99 each, so I had to buy one. They lure little bugs into their 'mouths' and then snap shut to digest the bug. Personally I think it's really cool, but my friend thought I was insane for buying it. You be the judge. Go check them out!",

They opened one week ago they said.  A small place with 10 booths and 6 tables of 4 seats. \nReasonable lunch menu from 11 to 3 for $6.50 to $7.00.  They have a Happy Kid's Meal for $5.85 consisting of 3 choices from a 6 item menu: 7 Chicken Nuggets, 2 Chicken Wings, 2 Crab Rangoon, French Fries, 2 Chicken on a Stick, and Fried or White Rice. They serve 17 spicy dishes for those who like the heat.  They also serve wine and beer!  \nLast night we had take-out from them.  I met the owner who smiled and shook my hand but did not speak English yet.  The young lady cashier and another older woman from the kitchen translated for her.  She wanted to give me a free 64 oz. bottle of Pepsi but I told her we do not drink any sodas at home and thanked her for the thought.  I ordered Pork Egg Foo Young, and upon eating it at home tried to give it some flavor with salt and pepper and soy sauce but it remained rather tasteless and we ate about half of it.  Our dog liked it however.  Also ordered General Tso's Chicken.  I asked if it was white meat and she spoke with the man doing the cooking and told me no, but if I wanted it with breast meat they could accommodate me.  I asked if they could make it extra spicy and she replied \"it is already spicy\".  I told her I like spice and to make it more spicy.  You guessed it!  It was almost without spice.  The photo on the back of their menu showed the chicken in the center of a ring of broccoli, but what I received was no broccoli but a few pieces of white onion and red peppers.  Once again the tasteless issue reared it's head.  Hardly any flavor, little to no hot spicy taste and the pieces of chicken were cut small, and were tough and chewy, but abundant.  We ate less than half of this dish, which salt and black pepper and soy sauce could not redeem it.\nI hated to give them a low rating but the food was 2 star and an extra 1/2 star for the friendly service.\n\nDoug T. voted for this review\n\n Useful 1   Funny 1   Cool 1",

We were not disappointed! \n\nThe decor inside was beautiful and clean. It was apparent that a lot of hard work went into the birth of this establishment. Our meal started with wonton chips. Who doesn't love wonton chips? We ordered off of the lunch combinations menu which is so affordable and generous in size. The combos are complete with choice of soup, as well as your main dish, rice, a spring roll, and crab rangoon. I went with their Happy Family dish...you've gotta give it a go when you're here! Hands down, I'll be ordering it again. My husband got the shrimp and lobster sauce which he also enjoyed.\n\nThis restaurant was also loved by our children. We have a 6 year old that tried and loved everything we ordered. Our 3 year old had his favorite, chicken nuggets which we were thankful they had available for him! In the end, we fed 4 bellies for less than $25. \n\nIf you are ever in the area, support this small business. The employees were so friendly and treated us so well. \nBy far, better than other Chinese restaurants in their league!",

The lobster bisque was smooth and flavorful and had lots of small chunks of lobster. Sitting next to it was a bowl of seasoned yucca and we sprinkled some on the bisque. It added a unique flavor and just amplified the creamy bisque. \n\nWe indulged with dessert and had the crepes which were decadent with orange cream and marmalade. My wife loved it but she loves anything orange...for me it was ok. Served with rich vanilla ice cream which was yummy!\n\nAnd a shout out to Dylan!

The Brazilian potatoes salad was a nice crunch surprise.\nI didn't touch the hot dishes wanted to save room for the meat but it all looked good.\nThe meat was tender, full of garlic  and so yummy. Loved every thing I tried except the pork in parmesan was dry. But it was very late at night so I'm not complaining. The bacon wrapped chicken with something I've never tried before almost like a chicken sandwich full of spice. The filet mignon was melt-in-your-mouth. I could have just eaten that but there was too many other things to try. Definitely a place to come back to for a special evening or if you're just craving ALOT of good meat.",

For the prices, it is not as fancy as others so I would expect a little less price for what you get here personally(Or kick it up a few notches). Again, overall, it was good. The salad bar has many many items but be sure not to fill up and wait for the meats. I felt the salad bar was set up and left as is, like the items were not being checked on or replenished. For example, the spinach and lettuce were wilted and the caprese salad didn't look very fresh.. can you imagine the seafood? Anyway, I loved the wide variety of wines Galeto had and the service was very Nice. Obviously my favorite was the tomahawk ribeye but I also enjoyed the ahi tuna, lobster bisque and salmon. I'll visit again if I'm ever in the area with a strong appetite. By the way-- it would be cool if all the gauchos were wearing the pants! Only one was.",

They also have off track vetting here.",

I had food envy.\n\nAnyway, the waitress was super busy and I had to wave her down everytime I needed something. We went there tonight after Costco. Kid's eat free on Sundays. I've never even been there, so I didn't know. The waitress \"forgot\" to take the kid's meals off. It's advertised on the colorable menus. Then when I gave her my Groupon, she said she couldn't accept it. Now mind you, we ordered a couple of rounds of alcoholic drinks, so our bill wasn't low. And no where on the Groupon did it say that it couldn't be used with a special. A Groupon would normally state that.\n\nAfter I am \"allowed\" to use my Groupon, I won't go back there again. We go out several times a week out to eat, and I'd rather spend my money somewhere else. The food was decent, but I definitely wouldn't rave about it. The waitress took almost 20 minutes to get our bill situated. My husband was annoyed that we were waiting for so long. The owner, who was very nice, had to close out our check and bring us a box. We never even saw the waitress again. Way to go!\n\nOh, and it was the same temperature inside as it was outside. I guess they're really doing that bad and can't turn on the air conditioner. My 2 year old was sweating for the first time.",

My husband and I tend to head here before the movies maybe about once a month. They seem to really have the food down...and then they change it up (have seen this on everything from fries to tortilla chips.) \n\nAlso, if you are looking for a quiet lunch, don't go during a sports game! This place gets pretty noisy with the 20+ TVs going and the fans cheering.",

She answered our questions while being very pleasant and friendly, smiling the whole time. She had energy and is what customer service is all about! This Culver's was close to our hotel, so we tried it and enjoyed the experience so much we went back the next day, and would have returned the following day as well, but it was closed for Easter. My wife had a salad and said it was perfect, while I enjoyed the cod fish and chips. The fish was plentiful, with big portions prepared just right, and came with crinkle cut fries (my favorite), and the cole slaw was perfect. The Culver's root beer is right up there with Barq's and A&W. The next day we had the pot roast dinner - delicious, thought I was at my Mom's house! We also enjoyed the frozen custard which tasted better than ice cream. Culver's is our new go-to restaurant the next time we're in town!",

Yet when we called we were met with an atrocious attitude and disgusting domineer from a Jimmy & Joe's pizzeria named Sally. We asked for clarification on some deals and asked for the manager. She continuously interrupted us on the phone and declared she was the manager. I really hope the real manager Amy of Jimmy & Joe's can get ahold of this store employee who gives her self promotions while simultaneously demoting her own company she works for, she single handedly ruined a $300.00 minimum order just went next door to the always fresh and kind Barros. Thank you sally for making she not only my self but my entire company will never darken J&J's ever again.",

I've worked in restaurants, I know how it is and how frustrating it can be. All I got was a large pizza and some wings. Simple right? Na, we got our pizza with ricotta and it was the saltiest ricotta I've ever had. I doubt it's normally like that because it was so salty it burned your throat as you ate it. Only 2 slices were eaten and the rest were trash. The wings we asked for well done and it was like they dunked them in the fryer for a few seconds and put straight into the box along with all the oil from the fryer basket. No sauce, just squishy chicken covered in oil. I tried for 2 weeks to get ahold of a manager to no avail. Apparently the best time to call for a manager at a pizza place is in the morning between 8:30-9? Whatever, I ultimately gave up because I figured the $40 thrown in the trash wasn't worth the time and hassle trying to get a hold of the higher ups anymore. Like I said, I hate yelp. It took a lot of nerve for me to post this. When it comes to pizza, my standards are super low as I love all pizza. I'd rather eat a frozen totinos than spend money on this garbage . This is the last place I'd ever recommend to anyone.",

I can't speak to the menu beyond the pizza but my coworker I bring in really like the wings. They have salads but alas I am not a rabbit so I have never partaken.",

My buddy suggested this place and he was utterly confident that I won't be disappointed aaaand he was so right. We got there 15 minutes before opening and waited in their patio area. Both of us ordered the Serious Slice with just plain ol' cheese. Let me tell you, it was quite a serious slice alright. At 14\", they gave us pizza cutters to slice it as a plastic knife wouldn't do the job well. It was fresh and the cheese was perfect. The price of the slice and everything else on the menu includes a drink. I will definitely be back when I'm craving pizza again.",

It appeared to have small dense cubes of something slightly resembling beef hidden in an overly tomato pasty sauce enfolded in a long limp bread roll. I had to toss it after a few bites.

Ordered the spicy avocado & lime super grain mix bowl and my fianc\u00e9 ordered the veggie burger \"west style side\" with regular fries and we both got a mix of of the delicious lemonades that they had prepared. The food was absolutely delicious !!!! The cashier was very helpful in describing all of the differences between items on the menu. The restaurant was clean and the same server was cleaning tables so it was maintained. They also sell beer and wine which was a plus. Overall a really great place to have lunch or dinner.\n***Update***\nThe manager Coral and the cashier Maria helped us out  the second time we visited( the next day). We will definitely be visiting again",

I'm fairly indecisive when it comes to food sometimes but I knew I wanted that. I ordered but was told there weren't any grains until Wednesday. It was Monday. So I opted for the southwestern salad instead. It was good, fresh and I did like the freshly grilled chicken, corn nuts and dressings on the side. When I'm near there again, I'll try again. People around me seemed to enjoy the burgers and someone had ice cream.",

They had breakfast specials that looked amazing, but wanted what we wanted!\n Great hostess and waitress was attentive.\nHave I gotten to the food? \nI did the Build your Own Burger, medium rare, adding Bacon, Blue Cheese and all the extras lettuce, onion, tomato,  and pickle. Also ordered onion ringers, which had a crispy coating like non I have tasted before. Originally I had ordered fried pickles, but changed to the onion rings, they brought those too at no charge since they made them by mistake! \nLove the extra love to the meal! Especially since initially they forgot my bacon, but the hostess made sure things were fixed! \nSee we walked in strangers and left like family.  I felt so comfortable, I accidentally walked out with my water cup. Had to walk back in!\n Yes, thankfully I realized! \nNow I cannot wait to go back and try the fish fry!",

We chose the Pot Roast and the Cranberry Chicken and everyone was telling us how much they loved it.  They delivered to our reception about an hour away and provided everything including cutting our cake after we did the traditional thing for photos.  Just remember to tell them if you want someone to stay or serve at the event otherwise they'll setup everything then leave and return when you want them to.  The plates were nice, linens were clean, delivery was smooth, food was hot, tasty and plentiful and pickup was quick.  Delivery guy earned a nice tip for taking the time to congratulate us, ask us how the food was and offering to pack up the leftovers.",

There's a substantial amount of seating at the shop, and easy access to power outlets at tables along the wall, plus free Wi-Fi.\n\nThe selection of tea is staggering. I'm not much of a tea person, but whatever I've tried (I'm not too adventurous, mind you), I've been happy with. I normally gravitate towards their French Press pot of coffee (for $5, you'll get about three cups out of it). The coffee is strong and bold. They only have half and half or almond milk to accompany it, but then again, what do you expect when you order coffee at a tea shop?\n\nIf you're hungry, Bantha has numerous snacks from local bakeries and soup from Spoon, which my wife has always raved about.\n\nThe staff is friendly, helpful, and likes to strike up conversations with their regulars. The owner, Jack, has built the business up over the past few years from a small tea counter to a neighborhood asset. The shop has a small performance area, two bathrooms, and the walls are decorated with local art.\n\nBantha is a vibrant small business with a fun cast of characters. Spend an afternoon there, and you'll see a steady stream of regulars and hear some interesting conversations while enjoying some tea or coffee. It's a great place to hang out at when the weather is warm and you're looking to chill out with a friend.",

Why did I give such a bad review?\n\nI really dislike listening to the owner, don't know name. Has a kid and is going to Iron Maiden concert. Only overheard this.  He talks soooo LOUD and swears constantly.  Every other sentence has sweat words and he is oblivious to customers who don't want to listen to it.  He is very nice!   But as an owner be more aware of your customers and their feelings.  One lady order food and drink to sit in.  She heard him, kept looking at him and decided to take it to go.",

Music was just a bit to loud along with the TVs. It's a sports bar. What should we expect. They have a smoking section outdoors but that day the weather was perfect so I assumed that that was the reason why they left the doors open but I really did care for inhaling someone else's lung exhaust every time I took a bite of my burger as I didn't order it as a smoked burger. The waitress was nice. The fries there are also the best I have ever eaten anywhere.\nWould love to rate them a 3+ or more but the smoke thing kind of turned us off that day. We will come back though it may have been an oversight that day leaving the door open.",

The trouble is consistency... you are never quite sure what day it'll be until you have ordered your food.  At times the food is very good and fresh tasting, but at other times (like last night), it tastes a bit \"old\" and reheated.  This is especially true with their chicken and pork dishes.  Nothing like the distinct flavor of microwave tasting reheated chicken in breading.  I'm not saying that is what they do, but that is how it tastes to me from time to time.  The people are nice and it seems to be a nice family run business, but I can't say it wouldn't be a regular stop for our family if it were any further away.  If they could simply figure out how to keep the food (chicken and pork) tasting fresh and not reheated on a day to day basis, I know we would go more often.",

Products and ingredients needed to recreate these adapted dishes are imported, including Philadelphia\u00a0cream cheese, Skippy\u00a0peanut butter,\u00a0cornflakes\u00a0and English\u00a0mustard powder. Also, General Tso (Zuo) never had that chicken.\n\nKwan's is American Chinese cuisine. And it is go-oo-ood. You can now order online, which for me, is tops! \n\nThe restaurant is located on the southwest side of a retail complex. It is easily seen from the street. The entry has a bench and service counter. There is no bell or anything, so you may wait there for a few minutes before being greeted. There is nice decor and a large carved statue that has been there forever. There is some new weird octopus lamp that was interesting. The dining room is quite large, and is comfortable. There is also a northwest separate bar. The bar is dark and divey. I never see many people in there, and I have never been, so I can't say why.\nThe food is always hot and tasty. Our favorites, and let's face it, the things we order every single time, are:\nShrimp egg foo yong. Large and dense patties with a thick, salty brown gravy. There are 3 patties in an order. Bay shrimp are plentiful in the patties.\nHouse fried rice. Soy marinated rice (brown colored fried rice, not white or yellow), with peas, egg, chicken, beef, pork and bay shrimp. \nCrab Rangoon. Not star-shaped, but little pouches. There are 10 per order. I feel like there isn't any crab, but I still love these little fried gems anyway.\nBBQ pork ribs. J loves these. Lots of sweet and salty sauce. He says they're great, o think they're a bit fatty.\nBeef skewers. A good serving of marinated beef skirt. Some farrier than others. But I like no fat, and J likes the fat. So we're usually both happy.\nThe egg foo yong is always served with steamed white rice as well. You also receive ample fortune cookies, soy sauce, hot mustard and duck sauce. \nThis is a great place to be bad. Try anything on the menu, and you will likely be pleased. Good service, good menu selections,  good quality.",

I put my drink order in he comes back a minute to two minutes later and I'm still asking about a normal way to would assist someone with selecting their mail knowing that they're new to the restaurant he left again so I asked him for his advice when he returns he told me what his advice was and I chose it.\nThe mail came very quick because there was nobody there I should've took my warning the food was not seasoned the way I was expecting it to be but it was edible and I ate that meal completely because I was hungry I asked for another drink thinking that there were refills on the lemonade oh no you pay for your lemonade each one which might I tell you the glass of lemonade if I would've known I would've asked for less ice.\nI was finished eating and my waiter sat down to eat his meal needless to tell you I sat there an extra 20 minutes waiting on him to send my finish eating his meal so I can cash out on my meal,  it was so bad that the other waitress had to come over and assist and take my plate.\nIt was so bad I had to get up go to the cashier and asked to see if I could cash out my waiter got up rang the ticket gave it to me in a booklet in front of my face at at the register, needless to say I was not very happy with the service there and the mail was very expensive one meal cost me $17.95 and he added his tip into the equation, mind you he short changed himself. \nSo enjoy yourself going forward and take it for what it's worth it to treat one customer like this imagine how they treat the rest of the customers, maybe it's one of those restaurants where you have to know the people that own it so you can get good service.",

I grew up with this style of food being made day in and day out since the day I started eating solids (not as recent as you may think! Lol). And I can say withal the confidence in the world that these guys are AUTHENTIC!!! I feel like I'm back in Dominican Republic waiting on my grandma's cooking...\n\nSolid place for lunch/dinner/anything... I love me some Mofongo, but like I said its all good...\n\nNow if I can stop in and NOT forget to check in.... Enjoy.",

The restaurant isn't the most appealing and the service was lacking as well.\n\n There was however something that caught my attention deserves praise. I observed what appeared to be a homeless man walk in and ask for a menu with no apparent intention on purchasing any food. A woman who quite possibly could be ownership immediately noticed his need and without hesitation offered him a full free meal! It was a very kind and generous gesture and on that alone they deserve 5 STARS! \n\nUnfortunately, they have some work to do on their food and the cleanliness of the restaurant.",

This place is known for Dominican cuisine and I myself am Dominican, I can vouch for the chef here. The food is tasty, I'd recommend trying any of the \"pastelitos\". Otherwise, I was very pleased with the quality of the food, the seasoning, the taste etc. Definitely delicious and filling. I would also recommend the \"chicharron the pollo\" which are breaded up chicken chunks. If you're a vegetarian, their sauteed eggplant is delicious. \n\nMost of the staff is friendly and generally attentive. It's nothing super fancy in here, just hot, fresh Dominican cuisine. Also, don't bother trying to check in on Yelp and use that 20% off voucher for checking in on Yelp. The owner told me they didn't do business with Yelp in 2 years and that they would not honor the coupon. Very disappointing, should not be popping up then if you wont honor it. \n\nWill I return? Yes, the food will make me return every time.",

He made some excellent suggestions and made the experience perfect.  The menu is perfectly balanced.   Nothing too complex, very appropriate mix of cuisine and flavors.   Great atmosphere and frankly underpriced for the quality.  I had the burger which was easily in top 5 all time.  I was tempted to go with the Spaghetti alla Carbonara but will order it the next time I'm there.  In an era where restaurants try to be something they're not The Market stays grounded and does everything really, really well.  Great place for a date (first or 100th), business dinner, long lunch (tip 30% if you're going to order 2 salads and 2 iced teas and stay for 3 hours).  \n\nGreat job, everyone!

The sandwich contained a hefty size of marinated grilled pork on nice slightly toasted bun. The restaurant also promotes locally sourced foods like Danzeisen Dairy. The general manager also spoke to us about the various items you can buy at the market such as fresh chicken and yes even duck eggs! He also talked about these native american beans they carry that contain a whopping 150% of your daily iron in a single 1/4 cup serving. I'll definitely be swinging by this place again for their food and the products they carry.",

There's no sign that says seat yourself or if there's a hostess. \n\nOnce we were seated, I felt that the customer service was extremely slow and it wasn't even that busy. I ordered the Carne Adovado omelet. I also ordered a cocktail. I believe it was the Lavender Collins. My omelet was super dry. I asked for salsa with it, which I'm not sure if they had any but they brought me salsa instead.My friend also had an over easy egg that came with her meal, that came out more done then over easy. \n\nWe basically saw our waiter twice. When he seated us to take our order and when he brought our check. Which took forever to get.They also had live music while we were there. It was good, however, since the restaurant is really small, it was really loud, so I couldn't hear anything my friend said to me. I probably won't be back for the bad service or mediocre food. Maybe if they were closer I'd give them another try. But for a 45 minute drive, it wasn't worth it.",

We were so excited to come here on our date night this evening.\nI am going to give a very honest and straightforward review. \nWhen you walk in, it is very confusing, as there is no hostess stand nor anyone there to greet you so we stood around for a couple minutes until we were able to scope out a waiter and ask them if we're just supposed to seat ourselves even though we made reservations. \nOnce we sat down, and by the way, there were only two other tables in the whole restaurant, the staff seemed very confused and disorganized. I'm not going to get into the details, but I will just say succinctly that the service here needs to seriously be re-thought. \nWe ordered the vegetable platter, which was outstanding. We then ordered the Caesar salad with steak which we had to return because the portion of meat was all fat and gristle. We also ordered the salmon, which was good, however I didn't care for the pearl onions, and I expected there to be roasted fennel instead of a couple sprigs of fresh fennel. I felt like the Mandarin oranges were completely disconnected from the dish and didn't belong. \nLastly, we ordered the bread pudding. This was hands-down, the best bread pudding I've ever had. I know some of the reviewers think it savory, but for myself it was perfect because I don't like things that are too sweet, so keep that in mind if you order. \nThe most disappointing part of the entire evening was that we actually saw the owner Jennifer and she was walking around the restaurant and we didn't see her engage with any of the tables, including ourselves, which I think is really a missed opportunity to connect with your community. \nI grew up in the restaurant business and my parents and grandparents went to every single table and thanked them and asked them how the food was. \nThat being said, we absolutely will be back to this restaurant because the manager was so gracious at the end of our meal, and sat down with us and spoke with us about the tasting menu. Also, I would come back just for that bread pudding!",

A group of four of us decided we'd go tonight since it had been a while and we wanted to support Chef Jennifer after her Chopped experience. \n\nFriday night. In the mood for fun, festive and delicious. The experience could not have been opposite. As soon as we turned into the parking lot, it seemed like something was wrong, like maybe it was closed. We drove in and saw the lights were on. Four tables filled on a Friday night. We decided to walk in anyway somewhat suspicious of the lack of crowd. It was only 7 o'clock on Friday night. We were pointed to a table but not actually seated. Still skeptical of why it felt strange and deserted, we ordered drinks and appetizers. It took a long time for the first two drinks to be delivered, and the next two drinks took several more minutes. We decided to stay for dinner as now we were \"in it\" and were having a good conversation regardless of lack of atmosphere or other guests. Sadly, no one came in after us the rest of the night. The other three tables left, and we were the last people for two hours to closing. The food was average and not what we remembered. What happened or what is happening? Would love a response from Chef since it looks like there has been no response so far to other similar reviews here. We still want to support The Market, but we need a reason.\n\nPost-review Note: Chef Jennifer did contact me personally and let me know how sorry she was that our experience did not meet previous expectations. I so appreciate her reaching out personally and letting me know that she loves her business and wants to do everything in her power to create amazing experiences for her customers each and every time. And, to be sure, September in Phoenix is a tough month in the restaurant business. We will look forward to going back to The Market soon and having a great experience. Thank you, Chef!",

We go right in when it opens at 7:00, the store is not busy and the bread is a lot fresher. \n\nWe get our meat here because it is a lot less than the grocery store. I separate the big packs to meal size portions and freeze it. If you like Kalbi, this is the place to get it. You can get it all year round in big packs. \n\nIt is a hit or miss sometimes. Is their is a product you like, it may not be there again a few months later.\n\nI have also stopped buying kitchen appliances (coffee maker, electric griddle, blender) from any Sam's through the years because there were always issues a few months later.\n\nThe discount on gas is great though! My tip is to go to the pumps to the right. Everyone tends to go to the left because it's the first they see.",

They have a location near 46th St. and Indian School that I frequent pretty often, and it must be said: their food is phenominal and you MUST try it. \n\nBeing from Detroit, I am a die-hard coney and cheese fry fan. I have NEVER been able to find really good chili-cheese fries out here in the valley....until now :) Yes! Chicago Gyro is my answer to amazing chili-cheese fries in the Valley. Their fries have this wonderful seasoning on them, and the chili-cheese is the CLOSEST i have found to Coney chili-cheese. Thats absolutely a feather in their cap. \n\nAside from the amazing chili-cheese fries, I am also a fan of their dolmadas, and I usually order them together. In fact, I have ordered them together so many times, that the nice guy named Brian at the counter knows when I call because im apparently the only one that puts these two things together. Seriously! I'll call ahead to order for lunch and this is usually how the conversation goes: \n\nBrian: \"Chicago Gyros, this is Brian\"\nMe: \"I'd like an order for carry-out....one order of chili-cheese fries with the chili and the cheese on the side, and one order of dolmadas\"\nBrian: \"Oh hey Brit hows it going. Ill have that ready for you in ten\".\n\nHe knows EVERY time. Its now gotten to the point where I can call and after he picks up I can just say \"Its Brit\" and then he tells me that my order will be ready in ten. Love it. \n\nIve also had their hummus, their gyro, and their greek salad....all wonderful choices. Everything is served fresh, and you never have to wait too long or pay too much. \n\nGreat food, great staff....many more visits to come from me.",

            "text": "I have driven by this place hundreds of times and told myself I should drop in when I am in the mood for a Gyros. Frankly my degree of motivation to do so wasn't very high. Everything about it is a huge turnoff ... the look of the place, the location, the general feeling that this would be a place to go if you were in the mood to get food poisoning.  I'm glad my \"reasonable and logical\" side lost out today to my \"screw it, I want a Gyros and I want it now\" side, so we headed over.\n\nOkay here's the point that I want so much to give this place a 1-star review and tell you to stay away for the very selfish reason that I don't want the place to get so wildly popular that some off the hook guy with spikey hair finds out about it and next thing you know the owner wants to make it all fancy and put a rooftop patio on it and start opening Chicago Gyros stores in Scottsdale and all kinds of other snooty places.  Because that would ruin it.\n\nBut my mama and George Washington told me never to tell a lie and I'm bound by honor and ethics to write an honest review. And the honest truth is, holy cow (er, lamb) this is one amazing hole in the wall restaurant!\n\nFirst off, you walk in and the insides don't look anything like the outside.  No rats or cockroaches or anything like that. The place is huge compared to what I expected and clean and kinda funky fun.  Whereas I expected some transient-looking guy to be slicing Gyro meat off of a questionable looking slab onto semi-moldy pitas Chicago Gyros has an amazingly complete menu of Mediterranean inspired sandwiches and salads and stuff like Chicago Dogs, Italian Beef's and other Windy City specialties.  It was early afternoon on a weekday and the place had a (short) line of customers but orders were ready lickety-split.\n\nNote that they're not cheap ... lunch for the two of us topped $25 before tip, which is about $24.95 more than the place looks like from the outside.  The Gyro meat was tender and flavorful and there was plenty of it. The pita thick and warm. The tzatziki fresh as were the tomato and onion slices.  The people who work there were friendly and laid-back.\n\nSo I've done a pretty poor job of keeping this place a secret I guess.  That's okay, as long as they don't screw it up and try to make it all fancy I will be back over and over, I can't wait to see if their Chicago Dogs are authentic (I bet they are) and put it on my short list of places to drop in whenever I'm running errands in the neighborhood.\n\nA solid 5-star joint.",

Overall, it was about what i'd expect though would have appreciated a little more production value given that it is Vegas. \n\nActors were enthusiastic but theShow needs some updating and some authenticity as things like the javelin throw seem too fake and you could see the riders pull up on the reins so they'd deliberately lose when they'd race. I get that there are limits on what they can do in a small venue (small for what they are doing), but they can try. Probably be another ten years before i go again.  \n\nAlso- the food wasn't bad and I left with a full stomach.  Our waiter was extremely cranky and I'd say a bit rude at times. God forbid you ask him a question. He kept reminding us he had 65 people to serve. He got the job done though, I dunno, maybe its part of the act.",

(You order your tickets by country seating). I was entertained! I don't know that I'd do it again, but I'm glad we went.",

My husband and I ordered a bucket of beer and got really into it! They get the audience to participate throughout the whole show. The food wasn't too bad either. You get a tomato soup, a biscuit, a giant piece of broccoli, a potato and a Cornish game hen. It's a lot of food and very filling. You also get an apple fritter for dessert. We had a really good time and would love to go again. My only complaint is that if you have to use the restroom you have to go outside the arena into the arcade area to use it.",

The actors are lip syncing to an audio track that is playing which makes it kinda of cheesy, but fun for kids. There is a lot of audience participation in terms of cheering and raising glasses. The fight scenes are choreography with added sound effects. There is a lot of smoke and flames which can make it fun for the families. \n\nThey give you tomato soup which was was good. Roasted chicken with vegetables and dessert, Apple strudel. There are no utensils at all. Just your bare hands.\n\n\nCON\n- no ketchup\n- no hot sauce\n\nI Know it's apart of the experience trying to be entrenched in the old times. \n\nProbably worth seeing once in your life time/",

This month, i changed that and scratched it off my bucket list. \n\nYou have to purchase the tickets before hand, and based on that it determines which country/ side you are on. We ended up being in Ireland. The show was fun! They teach you how to cheer and when to yell, its fun! Knights jousting, attacking each other with melee weapons, including flails and landing some loud hits on shields! Even some pyrotechnics was included, and it was fun! Overall, it was a fun show. I dont know if i would return, but the show was fun! \n\nThe food was decent too! You get a drink (bottomless) and a meal. You start with some tomato cheese soup called Dragons Blood. It was tasty! Cornish game hen, some steamed veggies and a potato. Everything was decent, fun to eat with no utensils. The meal ends with a apple turnover, which was good. We actualy got an extra one, and no one was the wiser. \n\nTotally recommend this show for kids, i think the magic was a bit lost on me at the age of 46, but it was still awesome.",

Located just below the casino in the Excalibur, you can visit the midway area and play some arcade and midway games while waiting for the doors to open up. A line  started forming about an hour prior to show time and they open the doors about 30 min prior to show time to allow people to take their seats, which are reserved. Refreshments (limited offerings) are served upon seating, followed by tomato soup which you drink from the bowl (no silverware). Once the show begins you are served your dinner consisting of a Cornish hen which is seasoned very well, broccoli florets, small red potatoes and a biscuit. Your dinner is completed by an apple tart. I found it very difficult to eat and take any pictures so you may have to sacrifice one or the other. I can't wait to return and do this again with our family!",

The prices were fairly reasonable, and the tasters give a good idea on what they serve. They serve some really delicious variations of beers you can find in every bar as well as some very unique mad scientist styled beers.  The IPAs were excellent with the perfect amount of hops and other flavors to make it distinctly unique from other beers.  As for the Mad Scientist beers, they are certainly something else.  I tried the creme brulee beer and that was not for me, but their jalapeno peppers beer was certainly exciting.  It's a hit or miss for these types of beers, and I can certainly appreciate their willingness to explore the different things available to throw into a brew.  Since a lot of their beers will go great with hotdogs or bratswurts, I recommend bringing some before you come, there's no food option. (Its a direct from the source brewery, what do you want?)",

There are 3 high top tables with uncomfortable (no back) stools and a few counters to stand by. I would rather have some smaller 2-tops that could be combined or pulled apart.\n\nBeer was a bit pricey, but not out of the norm for other breweries or pubs. The IPAs have some decent flavor and aren't the hop biting type. There's a nice mellow saison that's great for summer. \n\nPlace doesn't serve any food, but I'm sure they'd be fine with bringing some of your own. \n\nPatrons were all very nice and friendly. Wait staff and management went out of their way to be helpful and welcoming.\n\nI'll come back when I'm nearby. It should be a planned stop for anyone who likes to support local beer.",

            "text": "At the suggestion of my boss one afternoon, I ventured down the block to try the Corner Mercantile. The entrance is located at the corner of the building, facing the intersection (right across from Hello Bistro). When you walk in, you'll find yourself in the midst of a buzzing little shop that's got something for everyone. There are fresh, pre-made salads, sandwiches and soups. There's a line for hot foods, a line for made-to-order sandwiches, and a line for coffee. There's minimal seating in the front, however I think there may be more seating in the back. I took my lunch to go so I didn't stick around to look for seating, but I got the impression there was more than what I saw. \nAnyway, I bought a salmon salad with berries and goat cheese, and although i was a little hesitant about buying a pre-made salad, I was pleasantly surprised.  The salad was fresh and light, although very filling. The soup I bought was pretty good, although not really what I was wanting. They only had 2 to choose from that day, so I chose the one that sounded most appealing, but truthfully it wasn't what I wanted.. so that's on me.  I'd definitely recommend the Corner Mercantile to anyone looking for a quick lunch, or even looking for somewhere to linger a little longer.  They're options were extensive, and I'm told they have different things everyday. And yes, they have vegetarian and vegan options, as well!",

I can easily say that this stop is fresh and healthy - amazing for a quick lunch during the work day. They also accommodate vegan diets and food allergies really well. Of the picture items, there was not one side I would advise against, however, I would strongly recommend the sweet potatoes to anybody. I was also blown away by the juiciness of the chicken and powerful flavor in the salmon as well. \n\nI have been back since that event and was able to try a vegan sweet potato black been burrito which was delicious but a little steep in price for its size. \n\nOverall though, Corner Mercantile is a gem in Pittsburgh. Their menu is always rotating, so returning customers can always find something new to sink their teeth into! Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone and I will be back.",

I love the open, clean interior and fairly ample seating. Staff was incredibly friendly and provided well-presented, delicious sandwiches.\n\nVegan sandwich: shitake mushroom, butternut squash, arugula, caramelized onions, TLC make this sandwich absolutely amazing! The butternut squash was spread on each side of the baguette bread and provided a rich, creamy and savory kind of sauce. Caramelized onions were savory sweet, adding a nice balance to the more umami flavors of the shitake mushroom. Lastly, arugula added a refreshing touch to the overall well-balanced sandwich.\n\nPrime rib sandwich: The epitome of simplicity - bread and prime rib, which was cooked until tender. Although this was not a dry sandwich by any means (and the prime rib was again very tender), I could not help but think about something textural to add to the sandwich, perhaps something like an au jus, to really enhance the savory, meaty flavor of the prime rib.\n\nEdamame hummus: This is probably my favorite and comes in the to-go salad packages. The edamame is blended until smooth, with a chunk here and there. It really reminded me of a much more savory spin of guacamole without the heaviness or richness that comes with avocado. I truly wish they could sell just this!!\n\nOverall, a very positive experience, and I cannot wait to try their other sandwiches! My only other request is to be open during the weekends!!",

They must have mistakenly used regular chicken salad instead of buffalo because what they sold me wasn't spicy or flavorful. I asked for a refund and the whole team got involved; 4 people came over to ask me what happened and one of them tried to convince me that it was in fact buffalo chicken but \"there wasn't much red dye in it today.\" How could that statement possibly be (true or) helpful? Ugh. The mac n cheese was completely overcooked and a waste of $6; not exaggerating, it was mushy. I ended up throwing half of the Mac away. Also it had entirely too much smoked Gouda.

We went there for Restaurant Week since the ratings were superb and we had never been there. The wait staff were all extremely knowledgeable about both the food and the drinks. My one friend even ordered a ginger ale, which the server made sound like it was this exotic drink. We all ordered directly from the Restaurant Week menu and had the wine pairings with the food. Once they heard that we were ordering from the Restaurant Week menu, they had the lead waiter come over to the table and give us the details about the food and that it would be served family style for sharing. Our first course consisted of octopus and salad. Our second course consisted of fish and grilled vegetables. For dessert, we had baklava and real Greek yogurt with honey, which we were told comes from a purveyor in Canada. Everything was truly amazing! The lead waiter is from Greece, so it was nice having the inside scoop from him about each of the foods and being able to talk to him about Greece where we plan a future vacation. Overall, the food was somewhat overpriced, typical of a strip restaurant. The atmosphere was was superb and the wait staff were incredibly knowledgeable. Also, the restrooms provided a unique experience as each of the stalls were soundproof... I've never seen that anywhere.",

At three courses - great, hearty app and mains - the meal is more of an early dinner than light lunch, which is exactly what we did.\n\nI had the Greek meze plate as my starter and the chicken skewer as the main. My wife had the tomato salad to start and the shrimp and cous cous for her main. We split our desserts, ordering one of each (yogurt and fresh berries.) All of our items were absolutely phenomenal; rich with flavor and presented in a classy, beautiful way. Our deserts ended the late afternoon on a pleasant note - flavorful but not heavy.\n\nI docked a star for service.... the front receptionists were cold and our server was absent for half our meal; only to be replaced by someone else who we had to flag down for the bill. If service was tweaked, it'd be five stars from me. That said, I'd definitely go back for the lunch special. There's plenty to try!",

For under $25.00 you receive a three-course meal that consists of an appetizer, main course, and dessert. \n\nFOOD\nFor each meal, you have several options to choose from. Some require an additional charge. \n\n+ Appetizer: Fresh Diver Scallop Skewer\nThe couscous had a delicate flavor and texture, and the scallops were tender. \n\n+ Main Course: Lavraki\nDeboned Mediterranean sea bass with a generous drizzle of olive oil. The fish was also tender and flavorful, especially with squeezed lemon juice. Though it was delicious, there were still quite a bit of bones on that fish.\n\n+ Walnut Cake with Kaimaki Ice Cream: This reminds me of fruitcake -- must be the spices. Texture is more like a bread than cake. Plus, it was dry. I enjoyed ice cream, but had a difficult time detecting the flavor, which was very subtle, I thought. \n\nSERVICE\nProfessional and competent. Exactly what I would expect from an upscale restaurant. \n\nOTHER\nI'd suggest making reservations in advance. Noon is a good time, but the restaurant slowly begins to fill up within the hour. \n\nOVERALL\nExcellent lunch special and dining experience, and the price is perfect for the quality and quantity of food received.",

Anyway, there was a place in Arizona that had chicken and waffles and I was curious if there was anything like that around here.  Well, didn't find much on here before and it just so happpened that yesterday my Mom, Aunt and - were out and about checking out some specialty grocers on the westside and while checking out the old neighborhoods and low and behold, near the intersection of Lee Rd and Libby, I see Mr. Wonderful's.  \n\nWell my Mom and Aunt thought I was a little nuts when I said how good chicken andwaffles were and now I know where to come back and try.  Well, next thing I know we are pulling into the parking lot.  Yeah, how exciting.\n\nHuge menu!  Awesome choices!  Eat there in the decent sized, very clean dining area or take out.  We ate there.  \n\nWe each ordered the 1 waffle with 4 tenders and of course had to get the Sweet Jesus glaze on the chicken.  When the food arrived, it was nice and hot.  4 sectioned belgain waffle with the Sweet Jesus glazed tenders on top along with hot syrup.  Well, I was in heaven and my Mom and Aunt were pleasntly surprised.  \n\nWhile we savoring our food, a gentleman, who I assume was an owner came over and asked how we were enjoying our food.  Told him very much so!  he asked if we had tried the honey bun cheesecake.  Told him no, that this was our first visit.  Well, next thing you know, he brought a piece over for us to try.  OMG!  Amazing!  it reminded me of a cinnamon crumb coffee cake.  The cheesecake was smooth and not too tangy like some can be.\n\nWill so go back again and try some of their other menu items.  The dirty fries sound delish.",

Today, I ordered a number one HAMBURGER (specified no cheese)  with mustard and Tater tots- easy right? It seems to be an easy order at every Sonic - excluding this one! After receiving my order I pulled over to check it, only because they prepared my burger wrong the last time I came here! Guess what- I received a cheese burger covered in mayonnaise! I pulled back though the drive thru - explained and drove to window where I waited for a new burger to be cooked/prepared - approx 5min.  My burger is ready but no mention of the cold tater tots which haven't been touched and no fresh ones offered...whatever- I'm hungry! I decide to pull over and eat- thank goodness, because......wait for it.....it received a cheese burger again! I proceeded back to the drive through for the tired time, I gave them all my food and requested a refund! I also let them know I wouldn't be back!",

As a side note, if you don't have sweet tea don't tell me you do then dump sugar into cold tea thinking it's the same because it isn't and it's obvious as soon as I take a drink.

But I digress...let me just say I literally stated NO MAYO, no less than three times during the course of my order...sadly, when I arrived at home, salivating over my eagerly anticipated burger, I was completely broad sided by approximately 1 full tablespoon, not teaspoon, of the Devils discharge adorning my pathetic excuse of sustenance. Needless to say, after pressure washing the truck load of disgusting off my burger and rinsing the pickles in Muratic acid, I threw it away...thanks Sonic for ruining my hopes, desires, and probably the rest of my burger eating life...",

It was both bitter and watery, was pretty bummed, especially with it being priced at over $3.\n\nThe cookie looked better than it tasted. My boys loved it though (a cookie is a cookie, am I right?)\n\nHonestly though, it's brand new and I'm sure there are kinks being worked out, so I'm not too miffed about the bad cup.

The woman who works there with very short black hair has one of the loudest indoor voices I have ever heard.  In fact, when she is not there, the place is far more pleasant, but as soon as she walks in it is ridiculous.  That same woman on two occasions was eating food from other business like Chipotle or McDonalds.  It's the closest Starbucks to my home so I gave it a few tries, but I wont go back!!!  Instead, I head over to Coffee Plantation.",

This is very frustrating because I'm 7 months pregnant craving a sub sandwich and I cannot have deli meat unless it's heated up first to reduce any risk of contamination /: Alexis told me that this was company policy not to ever heat up any subs, but she did not know why and refused to help me. How are you the manager and you literally don't know about your company policy. So many things not adding up. Just help a pregnant lady out one time jeez! Bye Felicia!",

I ordered 3 sandwiches and was able to customize each one to each person's request. I drove to the 90th st. And Shea location. I entered the drive through and told them I had an order to pick up. When I got to the window he had my order and total ready for me. He was friendly and efficient. When we got home I asked each person if their sandwich was accurate and my son said his was perfect! :) I had a very good experience with this Jimmy John's order and location.",

Unless things have changed. Get into car, out of habit I count the medicine before leaving the property and sure enough, one of the main medications I needed to fight the virus, I'm shorted 8 capsules. I get it's late, it's 10pm, the pharmacy is open until midnight, these guys may be tired and ready to go home, but you done screw up someone's medication, short them or give them something totally different. Got to consult with the pharmacist when I went back in about the missing capsules, the tech claimed they were counted by machine, and next thing I know he is nowhere to be seen, disappear because you screwed up Billy? The pharmacist Justin T. went over the medicine and was very helpful, turns out I have to eat with one of them and since I have a sensitive stomach I would have gotten sick by not eating  with the tablet. Was contemplating whether or not to contact Walgreens corporate. Just too many negatives with this location tonight unfortunately, but I will be calling them today. Crappy customer service is one thing but when you consult and tell the customer something you have zero knowledge about and aren't supposed to, then short them on there medicine, that then poses a problem.",

I had received an email saying they were ready for pick up, and came 30 minutes later. \n\nThere the guy at the counter told me they didn't have my pictures. He asked if I had the right Walgreens. I showed him my phone, with the email, saying that I was at the right Walgreens. He shrugged.\n\nI asked if he could look up the order number that was in the email and he tried that, but couldn't find it. Then he tried my name. Then my phone number. \n\nApparently my order wasn't anywhere in their system. \n\nAlright, whatever. I'll just reorder them on my phone. I do that, wait a while, and then the guy at the counter finds my 4X6 prints in the 8X10 box. Jesus. I've been waiting for a half hour and you didn't check all the boxes?\n\nHe asks if I want to go pay somewhere else, because his machine can't give receipts. I said its fine as long as I get my change. \n\nHe scans my pictures, a card, and some candy. He didn't want to put them in a bag, because he didn't want to crush the card or the photos. I appreciate that, but I said it was fine. Just put it in the bag. I'll be careful. He doesn't. He just puts the candy in the bag. Whatever. \n\nI pay, don't get a receipt, and he pushes my card and pictures towards me because he wouldn't put them in the bag. I grab them, and ask where my candy is. Oh! Sorry, he apologizes, I forgot about that. You wouldn't have if you had just put everything in the bag like I asked. \n\nThe guy was nice enough, but obviously scatterbrained. He apologized for making me wait and for the confusion. I didn't care. Things happen. I wouldn't be writing this review if that was it. \n\nI get back to my dorm, and the pictures are wrong. Not even like they were shittily cropped or something (because that has also happened to me at other Walgreens before), but they were not my pictures at all. Like, I had never seen the people in the pictures before in my life. \n\nNow I have to pay to take the light rail back to that Walgreens to return someone else's pictures so that I can get MY pictures. \n\nAlso, this location is in the process of remodeling and it is very disorganized and smells weird.\n\nAlso also, this has happened to me before at the same location BEFORE the remodeling. So they can't blame it on remodeling confusion. They are just dumb.",

            "text": "This review is for the Take Care Clinic at Walgreen's.\n\nAfter getting over the flu a few weeks ago, I still had plugged up ears. I self-diagnosed myself with either a brain tumor or an ear infection. I looked up the closest Take Care Clinic, and took a drive down to Central and Osborn.\n\nThe clinic is in the far back corner, near the pharmacy. When you get back there, you have to check in using one of three computers, it is fast and easy. Next, you need to pick up a clipboard and fill out your info, much like you would at a doctor's office. I did my part, and then went and waited. There is not much of a waiting area, it kind of blends into the pharmacy waiting area.\n\nAfter about an hour, the Nurse Practitioner, Tina, called me back. They have a private exam room, fully equipped, exactly like your doctor's office. Tina was VERY kind and warm, and took her time asking lots of questions. If you are unfamiliar with Nurse Practitioners, allow me to tell you how much they rock. To become a NP, you must have years of nursing experience, including critical care, ER, etc. After years of experience and education, then one may attend college to earn a NP masters degree. One of the best things about NPs is that they take a holistic approach to patient care. For example, I have a primary care physician, who really, really sucks. When I have an appointment, she LITERALLY brings in a digital timer set for five minutes- and then starts talking. It was amazing to see her press the timer button prior to asking why I was there.\n\nAt Take Care, the NP didn't just check my ears, she did a comprehensive exam, full vitals, etc. Luckily nothing else was going on with me, but I am confident that other issues would have been discovered by Tina.My diagnosis was correct, ear infection, not tumor- which was nice.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this location, and Tina, as a health care provider. I am seriously going to just stick with that as my primary care, and skip the egg timer doctor who only likes to write scripts for things, not deal with the source of problems.\n\nSome people have noted that the area is sketchy, and with all due respect, that is silly. This is in a populated area, it is safe. Are there people of all walks there? Sure. Is it safe, absolutely. \n\nMy only recommendation would be that Take Care hire a medical tech to assist with checking people, helping turn around the exam room, etc. As a tip, it can get busy, so get there very early. They take tons of insurance, and my visit was only $15.",

We are so happy to have found this place, definitely will be back !",

My husband ordered the meat loaf dinner and the best boiled dumplings with bacon that I've tasted in a long time. You can get the dumplings fried or boiled. I had 3 meatballs dinner with potato pancakes and applesauce and sour cream. Very tasty!!!! \nAfter sharing bites of each other's dinners we both agreed that the meatballs are less spicy then the meatloaf. We had way too much food and will finish up leftovers tonight. $20 for both of us. Give it a try for when you're up for an adventure.  The atmosphere is plain and the people are so friendly and really go out of their way to please.",

Crumbl Cookie offers a weekly rotation of delicious cookie flavors, you're sure to find one that you will love. \n\nThe cookies at Crumbl are not the average cookie and although one cookie may be enough to satisfy your sweet tooth...you won't want to stop with just one cookie. You are likely to eat until you're sick. \n\nOn this visit we tried the Chilled Sugar Cookie, Butterfinger, Twix, and Peanut Butter Brownie.\nThere's nothing better than a chilled iced sugar cookie and Crumbl sure knows how to make cookies perfectly delicious. \n\nMy favorite flavors thus far have been the  Chilled Sugar and Butterfinger cookies. A box of four cookies is $10 and is well worth the price considering how large and thick these cookies are. The cookies are sold in a  pink box with a crumbl logo on top.\n\nSo, If you are ever craving fresh-out-of-the-oven cookies, try stopping by to Crumbl Cookie, you will not be disappointed .",

While the girl who was ringing me up was nice, her manager or the owner was completely rude. I purchased a few boxes to take to some clients, and didn't know that there was a maximum order amount. I bought 32 cookies, and you are only allowed to buy 24 cookies. I totally understand the need to limit the amount, as they routinely sell out. But This was not posted anywhere, so I was surprised when I was told. I understood and had no protest to having to only order 24. The manager however, rolled her eyes in annoyance  and told the girl at the cash register to just ring me up. So I paid, and quietly and patiently waited for the cookies. While waiting, the owner or manager comes over to me to go over the cookie limit policy, lecturing me in a very rude manner. I had already been told the quantity policy, so I don't know what purpose she was trying to serve, other than embarrassing me in front of other people in the shop. Perhaps she was having a bad day, but for the price of the cookies- I expect the cookies to be delicious, and for the \"customer experience\" to be pleasant.",

Our waitress decided it would be a good idea to take our order without writing it down. Well, that's when things started to head downhill. We ordered two Taro Bobas which was served to us with no problems. We also ordered garlic chicken wings which was missing the garlic sauce, so they were basically PLAIN chicken wings (Strike 1). We also ordered  beef instant ramen which I pointed out to her on the menu and she nodded yes. I stupidly thought that by her nodding yes she understood I wanted to order the soup. However, after waiting for 30 minutes...the soup NEVER arrived at our table (Strike 2). I asked the waitress when my soup was going to arrive and she mumbled something and walked away. Then she came back to the table with the menu in her hand. THE SAME MENU SHE NODDED YES TO 30 MINUTES AGO? What happened? Your super human memory failed you? She told me \"something was wrong with their computer\" which is why my order was never placed (Strike 3). Sounds a little suspicious to me because it was rather busy when we were there and your \"computer\" didn't have any problems ringing up the orders of the customers that arrived after us but somehow my order that I placed 30 mins before didn't make it to your \"computer\"? Sounds like someone is trying to play me for a fool! I do not believe it was a computer issue, it was the fact our waitress decided it would be a good idea to memorize our order rather than writing it down to ensure it was correct. She had NO PROBLEM picking up a piece of paper and a pen to take down the order of the customers that sat down after us. So, why didn't she write down our order? Because we were only two people and our order was short? It's obvious she needs to START WRITING orders down because she couldn't even accurately place an order of 4 items! Also, why llie? And if you're going to lie, use a better excuse. Do you think your customers are stupid? I wouldn't be this upset if you were just honest and told me you forgot, but instead you would rather try to deceive me! Train your staff better because your service is atrocious!",

It has red beans, boba, and maybe some other ingredients that I don't remember.  I've never paid $7-$8 for bubble tea before!!!  Ridiculous.  I'd look for nearby competitors for bubble tea but for food and tea, I'd definitely recommend checking this place out.  The location is a bit inconveniently off the strip near the Chinatown area.

This was hands down the best meal I've had in awhile and the service was on point! There was nothing I wouldn't order again and with the leftovers we took home I get to eat again today!! Yum.",

They have more room here than most boba tea places I've been to.\n\nThey have interesting items on the menu but since we already ate, I only had room for boba tea. I couldn't decide what I wanted: lavender, rose, Thai or something else. My original choice (lavender milk tea, I believe) can only be served hot so I went with Thai milk tea with boba.\n\nThe black balls were warm, soft and chewy. The flavor on the Thai tea was just right. It's about $5 for a medium and about $6.25 for a large milk tea but a certain person hooked me up since it was my first time at Tea Station.\n\nThe only concern I have is the parking. Let's all hold hands and be thankful I wasn't driving that night.",

We saw the lights were on late night and a group of kids were ordering when we walked in, however one worker was mopping the floors so I asked if they were still able to serve us(assuming it was okay since people were literally ordering at that moment) and the woman cleaning told us if we paid cash it was fine. Since my boyfriend only had his card, we said we would be right back because I had cash in the car. We were parked just off to the side so I grabbed my wallet & headed straight back in. As we walked in, we noticed the cashier had a distraught look on her face as if she was irritated that we were the last customers to come in, and I double checked if it was okay because I didn't have cash on me the first time I walked in & she was trying to tell me the system had already been shut down but she didn't understand me I'm assuming because the other woman had said if we paid cash they would be able to serve us our drinks. It's so annoying when one employee \"okays\" something when they clearly did not communicate to each other what was going on. I didn't want to upset or irritate her even more by having her make 2 more drinks which would have taken her what, an extra THREE minutes worth of closing procedures?? but mostly I did not want to spend my money there anymore because I've worked in the service industry for many years & the customer should always come first. Had I been rude & demanding things coming in late is one thing but I was so polite & very apologetic because all I wanted was my boba fix. They very poorly showed any interest in accommodating us. She very hesitantly said she would serve us but it was not genuine at all. That instantly turned me off & lost my craving. I apologized to her for the inconvenience & was very polite to her & even said thank you. Hopefully she felt a little regret & wished she had just helped us. I will never go to this Tea Station again. Since this one woman refused service to me, I refuse to spend my money at this establishment.",

The parking lot was full of garbage and carts scattered about everywhere.  I walked up to the store and found several employees smoking just outside the entrance doors.  I then entered the store, although I passed several employees none asked if i needed assistance.  I finally approached a young Hispanic girl probably in her young 20's and asked her if she could help me find a fuse.  Clearly she did not want to help me as she flat out ignored me and started a conversation with another customer she must have known.  Not to be ignored I stepped between the 2 of them and insisted she help me.  Sadly all she would do is say \"I dont know\" over and over again.  I tried to look for her name but she had her hair over her name-tag.  Wal-mart needs to fire this employee.  As I left the store about a half dozen employees were hanging out doing nothing between the two sliding doors.  What an awful experience.\n\nAnyway after about 15 minutes I found where the product should be but it was sold out.  I ended up driving to the Strongsville Wal-Mart and i was immediately treated like a valued customer.  I was walked back to where my product was and was helped with a smile.  \n\nIf anyone in Corporate is listening the Brooklyn Wal-Mart needs to be overhauled from the top to the bottom. 90% of the employees there are rude and worthless.",

Despite Wal-Mart's slightly lower prices, I'm not going back because their produce is not nearly as good as other stores in the area.  Due to the corporate model they use for stores, there is no way Wal-Mart will ever compete against even a sub-standard grocery store.  Why?  Because they refuse to staff enough people to provide basic customer service.  So I ask Wal-Mart, why even try?\n\nThe service here is basically non-existent, although when I filed a couple complaints via the website (about stinky meat, rotten avocados, and lack of cashiers), I did receive a follow-up phone call from the store manager himself.  His excuse for the piss poor store was, \"We're trying to hire more cashiers, but they're just not passing the background checks.\"\n\nOther things I have experienced here are long lines and messy aisles.  This store is the epitome of a crummy Wal-Mart.  Dare I say that there are some decent Wal-Mart stores out there?  Well, I have seen them.  They are real!\n\nI have to say though, I have had good luck with the auto department.",

Her and another woman were the only nice employees we encountered today. We had to exchange a bike that we bought a week ago and road it only one time. It had a flat already. My boyfriend went and got a new one in the bike section and road on it in the store for about 10 seconds to make sure all was good and the girl working in the sporting section told him \"please don't ride that in the store\" and he said \"ok I was just making sure it is working ok\" she knew we were doing an exchange. As she is walking by me she mummers under her breath a rude comment about him. Totally rude! Not needed! Then we get up to customer service and the bar code is not on the old bike we are exchanging. My boyfriend took it off not anticipating he was going to have to return the bike. But we are making an even exchange for the same exact bike.  So Melissa calls someone from the toy section and a younger girl with blond hair comes over also very rude and says right in front of me as if I'm not standing there \"why did they take the barcode off?\" In a very rude tone. She could've addressed me since I was standing right there in front of her. She continues to act as if we did something horrible and does not even make eye contact with me. And then another woman walks over who is wearing glasses I did not catch her name she was very nice and said \"it's the same exact bike just let them exchange it.\" The rude girl with blond hair seems bothered by this because she'd rather not help than help. So kudos to Melissa and he woman with glasses who let us exchange the bike today at customer service. You guys are the only reason I'm giving this Walmart 3 stars. I will not ever shop at that Walmart again.",

            "text": "We ordered everything last minute, as my husband and I always do. It was our daughters first birthday weekend and we ordered 2 days prior to the party. We ordered a red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting. And a personal smash cake for our one year old, it was buttercream and vanilla cake with strawberry frosting. She loved it! And it was easy to smash as you will see in the pictures! It was a bit pricier than we usually pay but for what we got it was completely worth it. Delicious! I think our decision with going to the cupcakery was better than going to a local grocery store, by far. We are very happy with our choice and the cakes were so good everyone at our party was asking for the bakery. \nOverall our experience was wonderful. I didn't order glitter on the cakes and they did have a lot of it but it honestly made the cake look better. Next time I'll just mention it, especially if it's not a child's party. Nonetheless, the ladies at cupcakery were very sweet and everything turned out perfect. Very professional. We will be ordering more cakes from them for sure! Thank you so much!",

            "text": "After hearing about my personal cupcake tasting contest in the big apple, my friend brought me to The Cupcakery to see if these little cakes measured up.\n\nPresentationally, these cupcakes looked divine!  They all looked so yummy.  I decided to go with the classic - Vanilla Cake with Vanilla Buttercream.  The pink frosting is sweet and I would give it a four star.  But the big disappointment was the actual cake itself.  There wasn't much flavor or taste in the cake.  Perhaps because of the heavy sweetness of the frosting, the cake was made to taste a bit bland.  \n\nMy friend got the Banana Split, their Flavor of the Month.  This was an interesting cake with banana cream in the middle of the cake.  This added some nice flavor to the cake and made it very indulgent.  He also raved about their other flavors, and I'm going to give them the four star because of the great potential of this place.  \n\nTheir interesting choice of names of each of these cupcakes is a nice touch too.  At $2.25/each or $24/dozen, they can get costly.  But when you walk into The Cupcake, the staff is friendly and the layout of the desserts available makes your mouth water.  You can't help but love a place that gets you excited the moment you walk into the door.\n\nUpdate: 11/13/06 - I tried their latest seasonal addition.  The sweet potato one.  Pretty good...slighty sweet with nutmeg and cinnamon, a nice touch to finish off those Thanksgiving dinners I reckon!\n\nUpdate! 06/08/07 - Effective, Thursday the 7th of June, they are expanding their summer hours until 8 pm on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays!",

            "text": "Let me start by saying the food I tried from this truck yesterday at the Mesa Food Truck Fridays event was great! Very delicious, very flavorful I believe they deserved 5 stars but I am giving them 4 stars because the portion size was a little too small for the price. \n\nMy husband and I were at the food truck event yesterday and after walking around checking out all the food trucks available, I decided I would like to try this truck & order one of their fusion tacos. There were about 5 options on the menu, some were with rice and others were pork options so I decided to go for the beef street tacos which are normally served on corn tortillas. When I was ordering and I asked for flour tortillas instead of corn, I was told that I would have 2 tortillas instead of 3 because the size of flour tortillas was bigger. I was OK with that (thinking it must be much bigger). For my side I ordered the Asian Coleslaw. \nI paid $10 for my order and waited. A guy ordered the same tacos after me but with regular corn tortillas and was waiting as well. A few minutes later, the food started to come out to people who were waiting before me but to my surprise, the guy after me got his food before mine. Not sure why my order took longer to prepare but I was hoping they didn't forget about me! A few minutes later my order was ready so I picked it up and found my husband who was ordering at another truck and we later sat to eat. \nWhen I opened my container, I was a little surprised at how small my meal was compared to how much I paid. I had 2 small flour tortillas (yes slightly bigger than the little corn tortillas we normally get at Mexican taco places but still considered small) and a small container with the slaw. \nI took my first bite and honestly, it was great! The meat was tender, the teriyaki flavor came through and the slaw was crisp and fresh, it was delicious, so delicious I was disappointed it was so small! \nAfter I finished both my tacos and my slaw, I was still hungry! So hungry I needed another sandwich to keep me going. I have not had lunch to come and enjoy the food at the food truck event and so I was really hungry at 7:30pm I needed a much bigger meal. After debating whether I should stay at the event and order another meal or go to my usual taco place, I ended up ordering from another truck. The reason why I didn't go back to loco island is because they ran out of beef one order after mine. \n\nVery good experience overall & a point worth mentioning, the guy who took my order was very courteous. \nWould I consider eating there again? yes I would but I won't skip lunch!\nDefinitely recommended if you don't mind the price and would like to enjoy a light dinner.",
